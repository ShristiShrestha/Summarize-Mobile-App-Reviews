Many features are locked, requiring payment, which is particularly concerning given the app's target audience of individuals struggling with anxiety and sleep problems. The high cost is deemed unreasonable, especially considering the lack of free content. Users highlight the need for more free features, suggesting a lower price point or a freemium model with limited free access to meditation and sleep stories.
