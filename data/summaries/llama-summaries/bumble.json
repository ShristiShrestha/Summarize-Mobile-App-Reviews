    "Denser_Summary": "Bumble is a dating app that prioritizes women's empowerment and safety. It has a photo verification feature to ensure users are genuine, but some users have reported issues with the process. The app limits the number of swipes per day, which can be frustrating for users who want to explore more profiles. The 24-hour match feature can also be limiting, as it puts pressure on users to initiate conversations quickly. Despite these limitations, Bumble has been successful in creating a safe and respectful environment for users to connect with each other. However, some users have reported issues with the app's customer service and the lack of transparency in their moderation policies."
