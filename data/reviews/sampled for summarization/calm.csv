Edit: this was a draft I made like a year ago still pretty angry but I’ll get over it(since sobre la oratoria is on Apple Music ) but I still had a bunch of songs I can’t remember the name to that I used to love^",1

No offense, but if the people behind this app can add passages from literary greats like Kate Chopin, Jane Austin, and William Shakespeare, then they can add more diversity by saving space for excerpts from Black & Brown best selling authors too.",2

3c2f43cc-cb1a-49e9-8225-5d4dfcc8c622,2022-04-04 02:49:07,I practically rely on these stories to get to sleep so calming I can put on a specific story and just pass out I cannot tell you once that I have not falling asleep toBeauty and the beast by Alan Skylar wonder or many other notable ones that I could tell you about truly 10 out of 10 app won’t fix insomnia but could help with anxiety 💜,5
9a887a8d-25be-4450-b724-57b44b3537b9,2023-04-19 20:41:16,I am very concerned with the lack of free things on this app if you were going to lock every feature behind a premium wall why not just say it strait up by making the app not free on the App Store… Follow up I did go into the app and check every where there was only one thing I did find and it was a meditation podcast I’m looking for sleep not inner understanding I already know who I am SLEEPY!,2
01817299-002e-4fc0-9091-5d40f125e85e,2022-04-03 04:49:43,So first of all you had to pay for everything and like that’s terrible like no I don’t wanna pay $41 for everything like I can’t do this like I’m trying to get calm kids for me but it’sFreaking $41 is a subscription like nobody likes his app this why I give it two star review like UGH nobody likes this thing that’s why I give it a two star review like I don’t like this app,2
88c188ac-0303-446b-a79c-fc44784c1c8c,2021-11-17 16:18:29,This app has a lot cool things and looks real nice but the meditations are nothing but body scans and the 7 day sleep meditation course did nothing for my sleep every one was a poorly guided body scan there’s a lot more meditations then just body scans which I already do myself once a day so this app did nothing for me except cost me 15 dollars I would not recommend it,2
30ffff37-53fe-442f-9fc1-26effddf5c44,2022-01-02 23:49:44,imagine paying for a focus/sleep/other app for the maximum 95 dollars kinda going overboard with the stupid subscription that you literally have to get otherwise you can't play anything other than that it's pretty good but Jesus dude that's really overpriced just for  an app,3

I think the intention was to give users multiple paths to the same destination but in this attempt Calm has really lost its simplistic charm which made it such a welcoming app to navigate when in an anxious state or prior to sleeping. Other unfortunate issues are a decline in the quality of app content and the continued neglect of customers’ requests for the ability for a playlist/ queue function for the app. Hate seeing developers lose touch with their customer base.,1

What I mean by this is that the gaps between spoken guidance are too long, giving too many opportunities for my thoughts to focus on something else, ruining the experience.  This can be blamed directly on Tamara Levitt — yep, naming names — who apparently assumes that you have the basics of letting your thoughts go down pat before you listen to her insights.  

Unfortunately Tamara, I have news for you: Some of us need spoken guidance because we’re incapable of meditating on our own, and your work leaves a lot to be desired.

It’s too bad, because I found some of the sleep stories actually useful, which would have been a bonanza for people like me who often have nightmares.  But the fact that the Daily Calms are TOO quiet and don’t have enough guidance meant I was getting nothing out of them, and I had to walk away after that.",3

The streak calendar will only keep track of completed meditations, but at the same time, you can’t click on a day to see which meditations you completed. On top of that, if calm doesn’t record a meditation you complete and you enter it manually it will break your “streak.” 

ALL of the meditations have the same flow format (ie, starts with a message, meditate for two minutes, ends with message), which gets corny and old. It’s time to put some actual GUIDED meditations back on the app where the narrators are just there to guide NOT to LEAD or talk at you",2

The wide variety in types of meditations offered is just incredible. From detailed visualization and guided meditation, to simple breathing meditations with very little guidance, it offers it all. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a lot of guidance while meditating and other times I just want bells at different durations while meditating, and I like that I can easily switch it up, depending on that day's vibe.  I was a little thrown off by having to pay over $60 right out the gate, but after giving it a try, I've now paid that fee for the last 5 years with ZERO regret. It also keeps track of how many days in a row you've meditated and the total hours.

I grew up without a correct understanding of meditation, therefore avoiding it until I encountered Calm. After attempting to practice self care using other apps and podcasts, I was underwhelmed at the thought of trying again. I believed that I wasn’t built for meditation and therefore could not benefit from it. 

Calm has helped structure a meditation and reflection routine in my life that has set a path of predictability during panic or any unsettling emotions/feelings. I rely on the content that is released to maintain a sense of self-awareness and stability that I have never been able to trust. 

If you are someone who passes by apps that teach meditative practices and self care techniques with thoughts that this just isn’t for me, use a free trial and just try it. You may be surprised and enjoy this new coping mechanism.",5

Able to focus on you and not the superficial things around you, since all you really can control is how you react to certain things.

I liked the fact every time I went into the app that they asked how I was doing. Within this app they have many mediation options to calm anxiety. The first day there is a 3-minute mediation, the second day it is 5 minutes, the third day it is 10 minutes, and the time increases by 5 every day until on the seventh day the time is 30 minutes. This app is a good app to treat generalized anxiety disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is an excessive form of anxiety and can be followed by uncountable physical symptoms like muscle tension, restlessness being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, etc. This app is a great way to reduce anxiety because the mediation that occurs throughout the seven days helped me feel more relaxed and I did not have as much tension as I normally do.",5

The skill of meditation takes alot of practice to make it a part of you, but it is well worth the time and effort put in.

I currently have about 5 months (153 days) in row! The more I incorporate Calm into my daily life, the more I grow , the more I learn and become more self aware. I am happier and Calm has truly changed my life in so many ways . When I started to really get into the lessons on Calm, an “Ah ha” moment happened and the classes and meditations being taught, “clicked” and I began to better understand the meanings, the concept, the teachings of mindfulness …🧘🏼‍♀️ But I credit the amazing teachers and mindfulness experts  for their approach and way of passing the lessons onto its users.
