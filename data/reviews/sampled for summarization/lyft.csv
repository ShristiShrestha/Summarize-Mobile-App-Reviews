27aba3ff-486b-481e-b3fb-982ea86c871f,2023-02-04 01:27:00,My husband ordered a lyft to drop him off at home he put in the address and everything looked good but after he was in the lyft he realized that the driver had stopped 1.7 miles away from our house so he tried to explain to the driver this wasn’t correct but the driver didn’t understand English so he tried to change the drop off on his phone but he received an error and his phone was dying so he got out at the wrong place and walked 1.7 miles in -4 weather when I tried to get in touch with someone over the phone I had to call 3 times the first time I got hung up on so I called again I reached the accident department told the person what happened he transferred me to the safety department who I told the story to and he said that he was going to transfer me to a different department that could help I heard the hold music and then it hung up the third time I called I spoke with the accident department in hopes to get back to the safety department but I was told that I couldn’t be transferred as it wasn’t the safety departments job to help with my issue then I asked which department I needed to go to which the person told me only the app can help me and that there is no one that I could verbally talk to about this issue I told him that I tried on the app but the options given don’t coincide with the issue we were having my husband couldn’t feel his legs when he finally arrived home.,1

when they impose to leave the app page open

two credit cards as payment method after four rides 
less than 24 hour lyft sent me a notification the credit card set as default declined accepting the fee
lyft automatically breach second credit card which was my personal bank account charged 32.99 stating withdrawal for a lyft rude in san francisco which is where their hq
no way to have any decent lyft customer service reach out 
they instead act like a zelle emailed me more than 3 times to update my payment where i already deleted my credit card information because of their mess
now am without access to my bank account as i had to cancel the credit cards i had on file with lyft because of the unauthorized charges
they have yet contacted me in that regard
lyft snap their fingers and i should say how high

i never trust them 

i just had to use them this week due to an emergency i had to run to the er and other trips affecting me

end of review 
never trust this company 
they enjoy being a mess",5

34508bb7-7cbd-4409-a99f-c1792dca65f7,2023-09-12 21:10:00,I have to catch Lyft early in the mornings it’s no way your prices should be darn near $100 to go 15mins away from my house sometimes $20 like your prices jump so bad and it makes no since I wish someone else could have a car service here in Louisiana other then Lyft and Uber your prices are ridiculous for the distance that both of you are charging and everybody here isn’t rich and those perks that y’all offer don’t give much of a cushion either sometimes it’s worse with those I just wish I had my own car I wouldn’t recommend either of you guys with those prices it’s sad I live 10mins away from my destination but you wanna charge me $25 to get there and y’all barley pay the ppl who using there cars y’all are real rip offs and I hate that y’all are the only company’s that service over city someone needs to come along with wat better prices and affordable and bump both companies broke,2

d44c59b4-30db-4f8e-98b9-8fed38cf3fb1,2022-07-14 01:50:00,it has become a frequent thing for them to double charge or hold money for a extra ride and doesn't give a percentage of lyft credit a option to do so or anything a lot of times they take they money i need to get home from work and they say it will be back 5-7 business days but i need to get home at that moment which is why i even got the app so if i got $30 on my card and i use $15 to get to work they'll hold the other $15 for no apparent reason so i get stranded as we speak im walking home in the rain as i type this only stopping at local establishments so i can check my belongings to make sure they don't get drenched and i shouldn't have to go through this just because they want to take money and give it back when they want really hope and wish they do something about this because i liked the app at first until this kept on happening i really would hate to have to take my money else where just so i can make sure it's safe and doesn't get taken without my consent,2
4d147f76-792c-43a7-a1ce-b1372af69fdf,2022-02-01 11:22:00,"i was overcharged for a ride i took on 01/31/2022.i took the same route i always take with lyft numerous times,yesterday driver dropped me off and never ended the ride and went all the way to waterbury, connecticut.my charges went from $27.66 for a roundtrip home to my daughter school and back to $72.66.i reached out to lyft via facebook they told me to privately message them in the pm and i did.only for the lazy customer support telling them can't verify my information.which is a lie because i'm logged into my lyft and obviously i know my name/ email/ phone number.there is no way to get a hold of these people after you get cheated out your money no customer service to help no even from the lyft app after i messaged them.",5
c5a456bb-aab8-4ca9-bfca-212917db5d25,2021-12-29 20:13:00,well it's been a roller coaster riding with lyft because i just started using lyft a week ago and the first day i used it was the worst experience you could have i guess i shouldn't have let ivonne the driver invite someone else to drive me to atlantic city because he was a very unsafe driver and he speeded and drove recklessly at times and then as we arrived in atlantic city the mood changed very quickly because ivonne wanted a off the books ride so we came to an agreement on $100 cash and then the driver who she said was her boss so i guess because he was the one that actually drove he wanted the $170 that was the price that was close to what the ride would've been which didn't make sense to me because it's not like lyft doesn't take there share of the ride so we got into an argument and i didn't know where we were so as we drove down harrahs blvd he decided to stop the car and jump into the back where he decided to start hitting me in my leg and thigh and then started punching me and i was trying to calm him down and i said whatever i will just give you the money and then he said then give it to me then he grabbed my cell phone and threw it into the bushes area and i was going to get the phone but then i saw him jump into the car so i didn't want him to take off with all my belongings so i was able to pop the trunk and grab my duffel bag but i wasn't able to grab my suitcase which had most of my clothes thousands of dollars worth of clothes i had cash and jewelry and other personal belongings that i really need but he just took off and wouldn't even answer the phone and ivonne acted like none of this ever happened so i was assaulted and then grand theft of my suitcase so it started off as a nightmare but since then the drivers have been great and they are just what i expected them to be!!! but i'm stilll upset that even lyft hasn't really got back to me on this issue so it looks like they aren't even investigating so i'm just very disappointed in how they are handling this or shall i say not really doing anything and are not even handling this!!,5

6fccc2a0-5486-4e0d-8f08-39754db78ad3,2022-06-12 00:46:00,lyft app does not allow any account holder to remove any payment options unless account holder provide their credit cards lyft policy is that nothing else matters but the credit cards not your bank account nor paypal lyft just wants to collect all your credit card information keep it for lyft use there's no way to remove payment options from the app unless you send lyft another credit card lyft blocks account holder access and hold all account holder payment options until account holder is able to put new credit card in place,3
d7381144-3bb6-487d-a871-cb7314e827fe,2021-11-24 20:09:00,i had order a ride for my sixteen year old to go to walmart and back home it was 8.99 she was told by the driver that she had 5 minutes in walmart the walmart on forest lane is always packed no matter what there lines are long and everything she told him well i might be longer he said time is money and your ride isn't worth the wait so you have 5 minutes and than i will cancel the ride and that is what he did and i didn't get a refund nothing and the support says well we can't do nothing about it because you have to make it under 5 minutes so the dude got 8.99 for a 4 minute ride to walmart and that's it never had this happen at all when i took rides to walmart and if you have the lyft driver cruz he is disrespectful and is unprofessional,1
1eb9adc8-2f2c-492a-ab02-c984e28fcb1d,2022-03-01 07:02:00,"a family member referred me to open a lyft account and get a credit for first ride but to my surprise before the referral my family member had checked how much the ride was going to be and it said $10.23 but when i created the account thru the referral link it gave me a credit of $7.50 for first ride so when i was going to use my lift app for the first time after creating the account for my surprise the ride amount for the same start to end destination showed me price of $17.73 so how is that possible why do they offer a credit for the first ride if they bump up the price to charge you the credit, i lost trust in you guys so i am going to close my account and delete the app and never use it again.",1
aa9df3f0-83d5-441e-9692-51ec760a4860,2022-04-27 01:27:00,i really enjoy the app it's the thing that gets me around as a teen without a car but please please please stop putting customers in queue for drivers 12 -20 mins away and add fuel to the fire by having the driver currently dropping someone off this has caused me to be to work late several times (causing a very on thin ice relationship with me and my boss) please just find drivers who are en route and not dropping someone off please it's a huge inconvenience but this is the best ride share app in my opinion cheapest and the safest to me.,4

Canceling when they 3 & 2 minutes away from the pick up if us riders get charged when we cancel rides then these drivers need to start getting charged as well or told they can’t cancel if they didn’t cancel right away because that’s not right to be having someone wait for a ride almost 20 minutes then want to cancel when you 2 minutes away why even drive to my direction why not just cancel right away now I have to wait another 16 minutes for another ride at the end of the day this is still a business & your drivers need to think about the riders your customers time,3

AT THE BANK??? then he just disappeared- like that was such ride he was 30 sec away from me but he jus kept running errands- but anyway they gave me a new driver supposedly priority- said it was arriving in 4 min w it started spamming notifications after the driver disappeared but this guy was also already delivering someone and it said he was coming in 6 min I GOT OFF A HALF HOUR AGO WHY AM I JUST NOW LEAVING??? WITH PRIORITY???

i am extremely dissatisfied with lyft not paying their drivers what is compensatory to their work/driving! 
lyft's excuse for price influx again is currently ""gas surcharge"", but lyft drivers are not compensated for their fuel costs nor are they provided a per diem stipend for mileage; so lyft is pocketing over 78% of what they charge customers/riders. utterly disgraceful! in conjunction, i've had lyft cancel several rides, only 1 minute before driver's scheduled arrival  w/out explanation and placing me at an inconvenience by missing prior business obligations and appointments. it's pretty inconsiderate & selfish how lyft which grosses nearly 1 billion usd, intentionally sabotages it's drivers' company -bonus goals by inducing them to ride/service deterrents which are obviously out of their way frivolously; consuming much of their time that could potentially be a utilized advantage for their financial bonus incentive completion.",2

They tend to be an extra 10-20 minutes late on top of the 10 minute grace period that’s originally set even when I schedule things a day in advance because the app keeps taking them to a street THAT NO LONGER EXISTS but the Lyft Map shows that it still does. Then I have to give them directions to the destination I want to get to and help them out of the area I live in because again the map will take them all the way around town because they don’t recognize existing streets because they previously did not exist there. Lots of maps already exist showing these streets and blocking off the ones that are no longer here but my driver told me that she couldn’t use other ones while working because it won’t pay her… if you’re not gonna allow drivers to use other maps whilst working in Lyft then at least update them please or if you decide not to update them allow usage of other maps because I am not the only one with this issue 😂

My only current complaint is that in some locations (namely Mukilteo WA recently), the app sometimes automatically accepts a ride on the driver side when they are not ready to take the ride or not paying attention (I wonder if they were sleeping in at least one case). That has led to two instances of drivers just sitting in a casino parking lot not moving or responding while I waited 10-15 minutes for them to move or respond. In both cases when I did finally receive a response they simply cancelled without any apology or explanation, which left me feeling a bit put out.

but why would it work at 4:07 pm and not work at 7:02 pm when nothing has changed re: card and the card was accepted at the bar to pay for dinner - balance was like $75 so it's not card.

- the payment method details are entered incorrectly 
nothing had changed since first day of joining lyft

- the payment method is declined by your bank
not likely as it has almost a $0 balance and accepted by bar and back at hotel it was accepted by amazon

 - the payment method is not supported by lyft. 
hello. mcfly? applepay??!!

if the payment method is rejected by the app, please enter it again 
so you are implying the lyft app randomly corrupts data so the card info - used a couple hours earlier - must be re-entered?

- pickup / drop off coordinates have been consistently wrong including, when the app helps me choose airport options (airline, domestic, etc) and the driver insists on a different drop off

- app support is buried in the app and also, completely useless. on a recent ny trip, i left my airpods in the car and realized 30 seconds after exiting. to attempt to contact the driver immediately , i first had to rate the driver, and then go on a journey to find out how to contact (was a single link buried in text 5-6 pages deep). 

of course the driver did not answer my multiple msgs and calls and actually, hadn't even set up voicemail (huge red flag). app support's only contribution was to remind me that lyft was not responsible for lost items thanks

both lyft and uber require that riders give drivers 5 stars (out of 5). remember, ratings are different than reviews. it artificially skews driver scores and could pose a significant safety and reliability problem.",1

I heard a few of Lyft driver’s honest thoughts on they operate the platform via driver’s perspective; they tell me that a rider’s destination request doesn’t appear on drivers’ end until it’s accepted or met their customer in-person. Today, after multiple of ride request cancellations, one of the drivers who barely speaks English literally met me and politely denied my request due to his recent surgery treatment in the lower side of his stomach. I understood his struggles with no knowledge of English at all since I don’t speak his language at all as well, which is Spanish. He was kind to me and sincerely guilty for not allowing to drive me to the airport. Consequently, it took over 30 minutes to meet the right driver. I never worked for Lyft nor Uber before, but if this case is true, then I hope Lyft improves this minor flaw by revealing a rider’s destination request to the Lyft drivers to help them decide for the customer’s request in order to avoid further stresses and conflicts to ensure better quality of Lyft service.

Best,

not only is this my first lyft review it is my first review ever!!
unfortunately it is for all the wrong reasons!!
i am a veteran and primary use this service to get to the va hospital 
which is exactly 7mi from my house
because public transportation takes me over 45min ,7min ride on njt lightrail to nwk penn station but the only direct bus route to the east orange va hospital runs one every hour the first at six am so if my appointment is at 8 am i have to leave home by six am
so i happly order a lyft 
especially compared to uber the cost was over  $15 less always on time fast safe ride!! 
then covid hit and lyft has lost 
there corporate minds!!
instead of being $15 less is now over $20 more and if i want the driver to arrive at 7:30 i have to startt my request no later than 6:00 am
because as soon as i get the message that my driver is 2min away 
exactly one minute after that it say your driver has arrived which is not at all true as soon as i hit the call driver button a whole different car and driver picture comes up saying that thier three minutes away and this literally happens so far three times per ride!'
twice trying to say that i was not outside and driver left and charged me for that no opolgy refund or explanation!!!!!!!
i twice ended up riding my ebike in twenty degrees takes me 25 min

until you get better lyft this is one veteran who cannot in any way

We tried many times to get the sunglasses back, due to the way Lyft’s protocols work for contacting drivers we had enormous difficulty getting through to our Lyft driver. After we finally established contact with him, he acknowledged he found the sunglasses in the back of his car and we set up a meeting time with him. However our driver no-showed our arranged drop off. Since communication with drivers while they are on shift is nearly impossible through Lyft, we suggested he drop off the glasses at a police station, at which point the driver immediately ceased communication with us. We escalated this response to Lyft customer service, they were initially helpful and arranged for the driver to ship the glasses back via mail, however this plan also fell through as the driver never the shipped the glasses and Lyft’s customer service ceased all communications on the subject. While losing the glasses was not Lyft’s fault, the Lyft driver ended up stealing them and Lyft customer service refused to take further action, which is a blatant tolerance of driver theft on their platform. Hugely disappointing outcome! I encourage everyone to think carefully about using this platform for their ride sharing needs.",1

“ uber “ has had countless run ins with the news because their drivers are not trained on the customer satisfaction and also because “ uber “ does not protect the driver or the passenger as Lyft does.
