d83840d1-4b4c-4072-882f-4d5e3270d4ea,2022-01-01 16:38:55,I find it hard after three year after trying to defend myself from verbal abuse from a girl I liked on your app I got blocked after she reported me for calling her a horse face after she made a comment about me which would be considered offensive to the lgbtq community I tried to tell the company but no whatever the little girl and yes I called her a little girl and a horse face said must of been good enough to block me I try and try to talk to the tinder app and no one response they had a computer ask me what my side was and then they blocked me I feel that this site had scammers bugs and underage girls I’ve noticed not only that if you feel like your being attacked or wrongly accused don’t worry tinder a dating app is there to be the white knight and virtue signal for women who like to bully and be abusive and use men on thier app I try to find the number and called no answer so I’m wondering why google and or apple support such a nasty app that doesn’t do anything it says it does,1
ca7e1925-1c5b-42fe-b09a-37b406f70981,2023-06-06 23:14:31,Today was someone’s 50th birthday i was watching it for a distance the Guy was not caring one bit for it ppl were cheering singing happy birthday but the dude him self was like Kill me im not wanting a 50th birthday didn’t think I would make it this far I thought I was going to choke at 37 this dude was done with life and I felt sorry for him ….party was dying down ppl were leaving and as the man was just ready for this party to be over a dude in a black jacket comes marching in a strikes the dude right in the face with a baseball bat killing him instantly come to fine out that’s what the dude wish for when he blew his candles out …so the moral of this story is be careful what you wish for it might come true,3
b76d3747-a1c7-4818-a4a3-37882508334c,2022-10-03 07:43:51,"The amount of 1 and 2 star reviews on here for the most part seem to be saying the same thing: bugs, scams, and ban issues and I’d say they’re accurate I bought tinder to try it and I’m not impressed I would lose matches that I was having good conversation with out of nowhere with no way to contact them anymore the app would show me people way out of my distance zone I would use the monthly boosts and do swipe surges only to get like 1 match on top of that the app is riddled with bots and scam accounts there seems to be an issue with the gender preference and worst of all you can’t even use the app without paying as a dude this app will likely only hurt your self esteem and as a female you’re likely going to get spammed and have to constantly dodge shady accounts if you want a date my best advice is to go somewhere and meet people because these dating apps aren’t worth your time and they’re certainly not worth your money until they fix the issues and I see other better reviews I won’t pay again.",2
ec4a831f-5800-4e24-aec0-0c7a650683f8,2022-03-04 04:59:14,"Okay so where do I begin as far as community goes it’s a decent app I’ve met some amazing people on the dating application all and all it’s not bad, maybe some one the women arnt my preference but their is someone for everyone 

My only complain is I’ve been banned for absolutely nothing, I hardly communicate with other profiles and when I do I’m always courteous and respectful because I’m not a creep mainly just a single dude looking for someone 

As far as the banning, I got it with no warning or even foreshadowing, I’ve tried communicating with their support channel but have never gotten anything back ever, if not for being banned for some random reason other then violations the community standards then I’d give this app atleast 3 star, it seems alittle over monetized and seems pretty predatory to me the way they market certain features and lock you out of other but oh well I’m banned anyways 💀",1
55475f86-6cbe-4ef5-8fde-e1dd752a7fdf,2022-01-26 20:28:48,Tinder has band my account and wouldn’t refund a paid membership without giving an exact reason something against apple app store policy I’ve even went to the trouble of contacting with picture proof and text from another user who admitted in the text she does this to people all time when they refuse sexual advances and all I got back was an email saying they take an accusation against me very serious will not look into the ban or contact me back but will let users who try’s to sexually blackmail other users under threat of bans these people feel empowered to do these things because you facilitate it by your predatory oppressions and algorithm tactics wait tell this happens to a celebrity or something and the media n lawyers figure out what you allow to transpire on your app,1
a562a247-baee-49cb-b809-2b1e9981e274,2021-12-28 22:07:59,This app is very depressing I tried to get on this dating app to test out my luck because the real world wasn’t working really well for me and little did I know how depressing and hurt my feelings I was to find out I was rejected by all the girls on the dating site I would text in texts and nothing ever happens all the girls schedule meet ups I never hung came to hang out I was depressed I wanted to do something dangerous at that point because my life is not heading in the right direction and tender just made me more depressed I started drinking every day to cover up my depression now I’m a stay at home drunk depressed sad lonely and still single,1

ad5a3b70-2743-44c8-944c-0766e7ed6f0a,2023-04-17 08:17:36,"Ever since this app tried to be like every other social media app the whole dating part of it basically was ruined, I used to talk to a good amount of girls on tinder and each time it would be about going on a date or seeing if we click by hanging out but now every single girl wants to have friends now on tinder, of all places to meet friends you pick a dating app I more hate this app now because of them just trying to be like every other app and loosing what the app was all about in the first place, a dating app not social media stay what you are folks since now I'm considering just deleting the app
Update 3 years later and it’s somehow even worse
Whoever thinks this app is for making friends go on an app like meet me or something you know… meant for friends and not a dating app… like how out of touch/dense can you be to use a dating app to ONLY make friends… you look stupid and like a joke",1
0ef20c0f-0f71-47b2-b36e-165c35b4b7d2,2022-06-14 19:43:02,I used this app in the past before with no issues especially on being verified and I decided to use this app once again it said this time my account was getting to much attention next time I logged back in I was already going to sleep and was asked to please verify my account it normally never forcefully asked me to verify but I decided to just do it while I was laying down since I was tired once I go back on the app in the morning it says im permanently banned this has never happened before and I’ve usually always verified my account in the past and probably with better lighting I’d be able to verify myself easier but I am upset that I’m wrongfully banned and this is a very terrible design at worst they should have given me an extra opportunity to verify myself I don’t get why it’s suddenly so strict on verification it has never done this for me in the past I am very upset and wish to have my account back.,1
3977a24d-49a3-45d4-8d22-c940e96084e8,2022-12-22 00:04:39,"A lot of the people that I match with don’t reply that needs to change for example if a person is not replying and or texting the person they matched with then that match needs to disappear and the person that takes to long to reply should get penalized these dating apps are ridiculous you get 20 matches out of 300 likes and only 1 or 2 people reply back this system is broken and just allows who ever to be on here 

         For the people who don’t get on much and       their account is just sitting for weeks on end 
- account should be automatically deleted 
      Take too long to reply 
- automatic suspension depending on how long it takes the the user to get back on to reply penalty should rang anywhere from 1 day up to a month 

I’m on here trying to find a partner not just to have Simone like my profile and not talk to me",1
e51a0265-abc4-47c0-adea-c17b0a52c94d,2022-07-11 19:46:52,Look I have had the app on and off for 5 yrs yall for real need to look into all the issues for example the fact that I’ll get a like and go to check it out only to find there is no like or the fact that you will buy a boost and literally get nothing out of it and I’m not ugly neither I’m not saying I’m a model but this doesn’t just happen for me I’ve talked to over 15 people that says the same thing not to mention the insane prices you have for your longer lasting boosts and one last thing for the people in small town TINDER seriously show the people that are near us in for the small town people there’s more things I could suggest but that’s all this is tinder is just suggestions I’m not hating I love using your app but there’s things I feel could be tweaked that’ll bring this app back to the app everyone talked about when it came out,3
eac0b58f-b169-4a26-a2fe-991f19e3244d,2022-10-07 23:33:19,At least with Grindr you can appeal bans and they sort of tell you why sometimes you were banned maybe you posted something you shouldn’t etc or if they made a mistake they will unban you but with this company they don’t tell you anything and you can’t appeal it and to be honest Grindr use to ban for no reason but now most times you have to do something they will look into it but tinder does not care they take your money and run … it’s a scam for sure the automated system ban is lazy and they don’t want to pay people to work to fix this ban issue so Everyone gets banned even if someone reports you because you look good or you not into them or the sex or whatever the reason … this has got to be one of the worse apps and it’s sad gay people have to deal with this mess to be honest I suggest you do not pay for this app and read reviews and you will see most of them are bad and for the life of love please do not pay for this app,1
c16bd645-dd28-4a1e-91f4-106f9c45701d,2022-04-17 13:53:57,I’m sorry not sorry I’ve been a tinder user for almost ever since this app started I never violate or go against Anything I’ve never done anything harmful or tried to contact in an aggressive or disrespectful I’m honestly appalled and sincerely upset that TINDER banned me and blocked my account then don’t even explain why or give any reasoning to help me understand as of why my account was banned ima daily user I’m even subscribed to you alls subscriptions I’m mad that you guys operate like this I honestly feel I was wrongfully banned I didn’t do anything and the fact I can’t do anything about it is messed up y’all should really have an appeal process because I really didn’t do nothing but take my money will you smh,1

I know it sounds dumb but this situation has thrown me back into the depression cycle that I was in pre-transition I simply want love and I think that I’m deserving of it and have given a good amount of money to tinder to achieve my goal.",1

1dba5155-56b5-4e39-b6a7-b0766a801302,2022-04-15 14:41:34,so I’ve had tinder before but I didn’t like it so I deleted my account then I came back a couple of weeks later and re-download it because I was really interested in finding someone so I made a new account use my other account that I deleted again then it finally went through my account was 100% everything was done and my Instagram is connected but it says that there’s no new matches For the past five days there’s been no new matches but on my last account it said I had about 99+ matches nonstop they kept coming but all of a sudden when I make a new account there’s none at all  that’s pretty suspicious because I’m using the same photos that I used on my other account that I deleted so how is that possible I’d like to delete my account that I just made for the second time but tinder won’t let me it kept saying the same thing over and over  please let me delete my account and start over this is an app malfunction,1

Please remove all affiliations with this and any anti-abortion group and take TANGIBLE ACTION WITH YOUR FINANCES for the betterment of women in this country.",1

The developers of this app have focused the entirety of their efforts to ensure that you will not find someone on their platform, hoping that you get more and more desperate to spend money to “unlock” the 100’s of people that have swiped on you that they purposefully keep from showing up on your feed so you cannot match with them. They’ve managed to weaponize the core aspect of human love and desire in a way that no other company could even hope to compare to. I sincerely hope the creators, board personnel and developers experience tragic and unfortunate events in their lives because they do indeed deserve it as they are disgusting subhuman snakes.",1

Just seems a bit selective and fishy to me now that Ive been researching for a bit and have seen that many women and trans people have also been unexplainably banned. Tinder is ok with outwardly stating they allow registered sex offenders to be on this app but then seem to not be willing to publically address this reoccurring problem that seems to be continuously swept under the rug... like literally I was swiping fine and pretty last night and was talking to a few men and then i open my phone this morning and see that im banned lol... like i literally read over all the guidelines and i coudlnt even think of anything I did that would have even applied to anything they had written... someone has to do something about this and please give me my account back!

I can find hookups easier then I can relationships but I figure that’s a given considering the app and how it’s advertised.

Tinder is a company that prides itself on its pseudo-guidelines. Be advised that Tinder does not care if a report is false they will ban you without providing explanation except an ambiguous “community guideline violation”. They are the epitome of the Web 2.0 company who provides near zero technical and or customer support and does so through automated means. 

They don’t care if you’re a paying member, you will receive the same level of disrespect.

Ban accounts asking for illicit drugs: ❌
Ban accounts selling illicit drugs: ❌
Legally peruse services scraping user data for their own sites: ❌
Ban an account with no guideline violations: ✅ 

This should all be evident as Tinder executives have received lawsuits for sexist, racist and other harassing comments to female employees, as such the same mentality carries into the app process.

I am also near certain that notifications are fluffed until you pay then suddenly all those “unknown” matches disappear. It’s a company with dark patterns who has capitalized on providing no support for their product, enabling federal crimes and has done near zero to ascertain the safety of its user base when meeting with strangers.",1

I understand if a communication progressed or a lot of people message a person and then choosing the decision to pay for that subscription. There is absolutely no point to have this app or even pay fees at all when a person can easily post their contact/communication details for someone to connect with me in my Bio for free also getting a free goggle chat/video/text phone number which protects your personal phone number from just anyone having it.,1

Yeah right then if it was the other way around you still can’t see them so it’s no point unless your gonna pay which makes no sense you have a better time going to a bar to meet someone then to be paying to look at a profile picture for someone who might likes you worst dating app ever don’t listen to editors choice.,1

Still Keep getting matches from overseas, 99% fake profiles especially in USA for some odd reasons, Whenever I switch my location to any other countries except USA it works like before but here nothing but fake profiles and spams , They make you desperate by not getting matches until you purchase the overpriced BOOST option which still doesn’t get you any match! Downhill big time…I wonder how they can’t control the fake profiles in USA but other countries is fine so weird. Me and all my friends stopped using it or at-least not paying for the useless boost anymore so sad to see Tinder like this and funny thing their verified profiles are all fake lol who monitors this for real?
Also, If a girl doesn’t like you for whatever reason even if you’re the most respectful man but once they report your account that’s said say goodbye to your membership they don’t bother to monitor the complaints they just shut your account down but if you report a girl of course they never close their account cause they need them so you can buy more boost!! sad …",1

Now if the guys weren’t interested in him that was fine but that’s no reason for tinder to ban him simply because male users said ban him. My thing is that if a male user or female user is nonbinary or bisexual or pansexual They should have the right to match with anyone regardless of their sexuality or gender because if the person isn’t into them that’s fine but TINDER SHOULD NOT BAN THEM BECAUSE USERS DONT LIKE THEM.,3

It is no longer a dating app, it is a billboard for Only Fans accounts or Instagram wanna be models. I have a Tinder Platinum account which I may only renew once I am traveling abroad. It is bad to think I paid for the developers to pretty much do nothing to keep the quality of the community.  If you want to try or is limited to just for US territory… will be much better to go for Hinge or Bumble, all of which you don’t have to pay one bucket to enjoy good quality stuff (bumble may still have some similar accounts, but way less than Tinder).

Two stars just because I am still using it and will use for traveling in Latin America and Europe, but for the US alone is down to just 1 star if not less",2

The app is plagued with sketchy escort service offers and bot accounts that are likely using someone else’s photos to lure you to their Instagram where you can find links to paywalls for sexually explicit content. Porn is free and very accessible, no one needs all these other steps. Tinder doesn’t seem to care about people exploiting their app for their borderline illegal and depraved marketing practices since the amount of times I’ve come across these accounts have only increased and become more prevalent. Likely deleting the app soon and moving to something a little less slimy and gross to use.",1

The next day when I went to check the app it said that my profile contained content that violated their standards but they wouldn’t explain how or show me any proof I’d done something wrong, I only assume it was the man who I told to stop being overtly sexual was angry and reported me, now 2 years later I’m still banned from the app?!

Then the girl starts messaging me bad stuff so I block her the next thing I know tinder banned me. I did nothing wrong and they refuse to listen to me.

Furthermore it knows that I know this given that it is showing me these likes, so they are putting them in a hostage situation, holding my romantic opportunity at ransom of paying their premium price just for me to achieve the purpose the app claims you can achieve without paying.

I try not to do this often, but I’ve seen minors using the app, clearly fake accounts trying to direct me offsite, 18 year olds soliciting adults to purchase them alcohol and tobacco products, and people selling all manner of illicit substances. I report them, using the correct category, and then see them again a day or two later.

There isn’t an option to report them, because Tinder is aware they aren’t real and just an ad. I don’t know what developer had this idea, but feeding in paid, sponsored ads to the ONE part of your service that is actually functional, basically destroys your platform and trust with your users.

I used to get 20 matches per day and now I get maybe 1 per week. I certainly haven’t gotten that much uglier over the past 3 years. I really think the early years of Tinder were part of a longer term strategy - bait them in, show them the awesomeness - then pull the rug out from under them and make them pay for each morsel of the way things once were. Also, the liberal agenda behind these apps just gets old. They won’t let you filter by ethnicity, you can’t filter out transgendered “women”, they only offer tags like BLM,  LBGQ, Pronouns, Vaccinated, etc - they offer only liberal categories for everything. Dating apps, social media platforms and news media outlets are all hyper focused on transforming our society and our country into a giant pile of crap.

Could be that just so many people pay for it, it’s useless, but that’s a tinder issue to resolve.

And even worse they choose to ban people randomly without warning or anything… while anybody that’s spent more than 3 minutes on the app knows the vitriol on here but nothing is done about that… the amount of people using it just to promote paying for sex, only fans, or scam fake accounts… but they randomly ban people without warning or any explanation is baffling. Sad state of affairs that everything has become. I guess I should thank Tinder for allowing me that 1-2 hours back I’ve been wasting using their app. Tinder single handedly by poor management will bring back in person dating.",1
b85f3dda-2064-4d13-9c72-03f05cf8bdd8,2023-11-12 12:53:32,"In my opinion, articles (research) show that Tinder does not guarantee someone will find a ""match"" worth pursuing for an actual healthy, meaningful and worthwhile relationship. Even though it does not charge the most amount of money for its services, most of the matches sent to me have been, respectfully and respectively, single mom's or similar users (women). Thus, the App has only been worthwhile for acquiring this knowledge. Otherwise, I don't foresee myself using it anytime soon again, if ever.",1

After multiple sessions of emails back and forth with support I was flat out told, they also don’t know the reason I was banned, and they also will not do anything to fix it. What is the point of having a support team for this god forsaken app anyways? I guarantee there is no valid reason they could have given me considering I shut down my tinder of my own volition before trying to get back on.",1
e4795b9a-a7ee-48b6-8be7-42d57061c3cf,2023-10-18 11:35:17,This app has perfected the art of reducing human connections to mere swipes and shallow judgments. The promise of finding meaningful relationships is a cruel illusion as most users are most interested in their ego boosts than genuine interactions. Prepare for a barrage of catfish profiles ghosting and cringeworthy pick up lines. The premium features are an expensive joke offering no real advantage in the futile quest for love. If you value your self esteem and sanity steer clear of this app. Tinder’s fleeting sparks are more likely to leave you burned than warmed.,1

While I understand, I may not be an absolute male supermodel, I’m talking I have had less than 10 total profile likes in four days, while spending two entire days in my home area, and now two more days traveling the East Coast.

Match with a gal and see sends you a link to her snapchat or insta… explain you don’t have either and they unmatch, etc. time wasters! Started a new company and when i get a heads up someone liked me, I’ve paid for a year of the platinum membership, I’d send them a link to my instagram i sent up for what I’m doing. Tinder tell me i violated their terms of agreement and bans me permanently without issue a refund or an explanation but the times I’ve reported fake accounts they tell me there’s nothing they can do 😒 How on earth would i have guessed sending someone a link to what I’m working on is a violation of anything when such an insanely huge percentage of the women on the app are fake profiles that ONLY attempt to drive traffic to their social media 🤔 Then I’m not entitled to a reimbursement of the prorated amount of my membership, which isn’t cheap BTW.",1

They gave me a canned answer about my account being reported for violating the terms of use or guidelines and that they cannot tell me why I was banned or unban my account. All Match Group dating services are suspect to the same tactics and I’m convinced they don’t even have a customer service department because if they had truly reviewed my ban, it would have been abundantly clear I had done nothing wrong. Buyer beware, Match Group are frauds and conmen.",1

Please understand that if your account has been banned for violating our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines.

The wlw side of tinder is unusable because of it the fact I have to swipe right 80% of the time to avoid those types of people and will rarely get a match with people I actually wanted to swipe right on. Tinder gold or anything you have to pay for is a complete waste of money because of the 3 types of people I mentioned before. Can we ban couples or like have there own separate thing cause there is no reason I should have to be tortured into having to deal with gross men 24/7 on the WOMEN side of the app.",1

The criteria search is only limited to a binary function for results, so if you’re gender non-conforming in any way this app will rip you to shreds.  It will expose you to transphobes and people who break the ToS without a second thought, all while hammering down over the slightest thing if you identify as anything outside the man/woman binary.  My own account was banned without any real context or explanation for what I had done.  Nothing was being solicited and I wasn’t showing nudity.  Nor was I one of the countless profiles that have animal victims from hunting. If Tinder wants to officially correct their missteps, they can start by actually filtering out bot accounts and quit being hypocritical with their flimsy ToS.",1

When I wanted to delete this person’s account, I wasn’t able to get past the verification page because logging in through a different device probably triggered that. I submitted my pictures for verification (even though they weren’t the same as the ones on this impersonator’s profile) I was not given the chance to even delete the account but instead they banned my phone number, device ID, and any identifier that’s linked to me. When I reached out to customer support, and explained what’s going on, they were gaslighting me and said that there’s no way for them to unban me because I “violated their user agreement policy”. That’s what happens when your information is hijacked and apps simply do not care about ensuring that your data is secure.",1

I would like to say I hope this app fails, but it is already too big and filled with desperate simps who will keep it alive as a place for sad undateable dudes to pay for some chick to undress. The most i CAN hope for is that someone with a shred of self-respect will read this and cancel the download they are waiting on while they read reviews haha.",1

It’s feels like they’re trying to punish users who don’t pay for any of their overpriced services by feeding them bots, (employees who try and rip off customers who are using the free feature), and con artists who try to lead people away from Tender into some other scam or featured platform that doesn’t lead to a meeting.
Having said that, I do meet new users who genuinely want to meet another living person. Sadly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to actually encounter a real person who also is really interested in meeting up.
I don’t see how this is supposed to encourage people to become paying customers. What happened to the Tender from 12 years ago? When you could find company for the evening on the same evening you were looking…sheesh!
Now you have to delete the app and reinstall it again just to get a new load of bots and profiles to sift through that are actually in your location…I’m thinking Tender actually died a long time ago and this is just the internet remnants of the original idea.",1

However, I just recently downloaded again and tried logging in, and found out I am still banned - although I was previously informed this would be reversed.  I messaged customer support for help and explanation, to which the only information and statements they are able to provide is me across multiple correspondences is “Your account has been banned for violations of our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines, which we take very seriously.”
