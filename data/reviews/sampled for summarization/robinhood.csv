update
They finally wrote back to me too little too late the opportunity has passed they were unable to fix or even have any idea what the problem was they contacted me about margin which I have no intention of using or wanting to use The problem was I couldn’t purchase a particular cryptocurrency I don’t know why I couldn’t at the time now I can but it doesn’t matter because the opportunity is gone and I can confirm again with absolute satisfaction that this app is trash with a capital T if I could give you zero stars I would don’t bother wasting your time.",1

I gave ID and now they want me to email social security card after I gave last four of my social ..waiting over 2 months and they give you a spin around put you on hold nonstop..hopefully it’s not issues they purposely place on minorities...

Also they keep throwing at you an email a 3 day wait for customer service to assist but not really assisting .... one of the worst services you can expect and they ask you to send picture copies of your social security card ...usually they ask for last 4 of the social ...is that really legal to ask for copies of it through an online app that has bad customer service (over 3day wait ..same letter when you respond too )",1
643bbfff-69c5-40ac-9d0a-47cd00bf4b5b,2022-06-21 15:12:55,So I’ve had an incident where I recently got a new phone and was trying to log into my Robinhood account and I didn’t realize I had to update the phone number after I got my new phone so I called the customer support team to help me and it’s been six months and they still have not updated my phone number so I can use my account and at this point I really feel like they’re kind of just withholding my money and it’s kind of uncomfortable considering that they have all my bank information and credit card information and they even contact the support team and ask them to fix it and they said they would get right on it and it’s been six months and nothing has happened really really bad customer service would really recommend never using this app they don’t do very well in helping their customers when there’s a problem and they don’t seem to really care very much as far as the fact that I asked for help and it seems to be that nobody’s helping you within six months very very bad customer service would never recommend using this app again,2

bd4469fa-d87f-4184-a5f8-2135f7bad58e,2021-01-29 19:53:55,they are the complete opposite of a robinhood as they so call themselves they manipulate users into their game of buy buy buy into these stocks providing you with a false sense of security by not allowing you to buy in or sell out and times most critical to you and your wallet the operation of this app isn’t as free of a market as they make it seem they will cancel your orders and sometimes the orders do not even go through and they still proceed to take your money for a failed or non executed order once a sell is made with their crypto the funds do not immediately return so you could buy in at a better price they instead make you wait long periods of time before you can reinvest this is saving the rich from the working class because the boys in the suits are losing at their own game and robinhood is backing the rich instead of the working class people that are just trying to make some money like everyone else so my advice don’t invest with robinhood they are very sneaky and have proven this week to be very untrustworthy!,1

My whole lives changed for the best
No more DOS writing commands 
I remember looking at someone computer screen in Manhattan whiles I was doing an electrical repair 
He was buying stock  placing orders over the phone while looking at his computer screen 
Then he looked at me and said this is not for everyone 
Thanks robinhood for opening a window of opportunity that was once denied to me 
Today I am economically better than what I was in my younger years 
Thank you and keep up the good work 
Financial freedom for everyone",5

35c3740c-1b18-40d4-b8c6-87bf0615d1d6,2021-03-15 21:07:21,Robin Hood is a great app for the beginner with that being said there’s a lot to improve it’s very difficult to get Lehmans responses you get generic responses back when you contact their customer service via email Robin Hood is supposed to be for the beginner it doesn’t really explain a lot of things for them to understand like margin calls being locked out if you do more than X number of day trades that you should look up will call you a pattern trade or just look at that you’ll put a buying or sell of your options and Robin Hood will cancel it without any email is to explain why it got canceled somethings will sell really quick in Robin Hood other things will sit and ponder the universe for the next day Very hard to sell pre-market or buy pre-market,1
84b73e4c-4909-4c9e-be12-e81710bc2a5e,2021-02-03 05:53:11,"Here is a few things other than Robinhood’s recent restrictions on buying stocks 
1) Robinhood sells your options an hour before the market closes, let’s say you have an option contract worth 50$ at 2:00 P.M. and you chose to wait till 3:00, Robinhood sells it for lower than market price ( it doesn’t market sell )
2) what happened with Reddit stocks can happen with any stock on a volatile day, however it didn’t happen with KODK, let’s say the volatility was too high with GME, Robinhood is still unprepared for future events. To understand this better if everyone at Reddit chose AAPL instead, Robinhood would’ve still done the same as it doesn’t have enough money to clear the sales, which again brings back false advertising 
3) people committed suicide cuz of Robinhood’s exploitation of amateur traders by lucrative margin offers and stupidly ridiculous user interface which is claimed to be user friendly however in stock market you need informative interface over bright colors that make it seem like a game 
4) options are going to ruin the stock market due the bubble they create, Robinhood made this worse by approving amateur traders to trade options, for example I convinced my friend to create an account in Robinhood with a portfolio value of 300$ and 2 days later he got his options enabled, same guy who banks with chase and had an investment account with them for over a month with 2000$ in portfolio value got denied.",1

I’m learning how to research companies I’m interested in and how to watch their stock prices to decide the best time to buy ( in my opinion).. they ask for personal info like bank and tax stuff (which I expected but some do not understand..it’s not like buy shoes) ..

A thousand years from now
And not because he passed some laws
Or had that lofty brow
While bonny good King Richard leads
The great crusade he's on
We'll all have to slave away
For that good-for-nothin' John!
Incredible as he is inept
Whenever the history books are kept
They'll call him the phony king of England
A pox on the phony king of England!

He sits alone on a giant throne
Pretendin' he's the king
A little tyke who's rather like
A puppet on a string
And he throws an angry tantrum
If he cannot have his way...

And then he calls for Mum
While he's suckin' his thumb
You see, he doesn't want to play

Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the worst
A pox on that phony king of England!

While he taxes us to pieces
And he robs us of our bread
King Richard's crown keeps slippin' down
Around that pointed head
Ah! But while there is a merry man
In Robin's wily pack
We'll find a way to make him pay
And steal our money back
A minute before he knows we're there...

Ol' Rob'll snatch his underwear

The breezy and uneasy king of England
The snivellin', grovellin'
Measly, weasely
Blabberin', jabberin'
Gibberin', jabberin'
Blunderin', plunderin'
Wheelin', dealin'

*RH team is always updating and introducing new features 
*accounts are FDIC Insured up to 250k

CONS:

I am immediately opened up a new account under JP Morgan and I’ve had zero issues and would highly recommend them.

They are supporting the big institutions and manipulating the market, not for retail investors but for the interests of bailing out the large institutions when they are on the loosing side of their positions, deplorable, and frankly illegal activity.

They have proven they are in the pocket of said hedge funds, money managers, and institutions that are against free retail traders because they present a new factor to market against the ways those institutions manipulate the market and factor in risk.  Manipulation by stopping buying should be illegal, transparency to the ways hedge funds, money managers, and institutions manipulate the market should be the answer (causing short laddering, allowing short positions to exceed available stocks or risky positions, uncovered options)

They should also REALLY warn especially new users that the buy it now price is not the actual buy it now and that RobinHood will add extra charges to it which they should look into why its doing that when told one amount it charges a second higher amount when initiating.

This level of shorting should not be allowed, then to make it worse Robinhood, presumably on free will, decided to aid these fraudulent hedge funds in order to protect them from losing money.

The decision to disable only one side of trades was horrible by itself, since it presented optics in line with protecting institutional investors to the detriment of retail investors who are the company’s customers, but was then compounded.  The decision to stay silent about the reason for the action was made despite the fact that the liquidity shortfall that required suspension of buys was not a result of any actual problem with the company itself, but rather of unprecedented trading volume upticks triggering massive increases in clearinghouse deposit requirements.

But since they’re a few coins that have gained popularity in the app such as DOGE, it would best to see if they may want to add a few more alt coins in there that are trending in popularity or traction that can be bought or sold in order to have additional income progressing as some alt coins have done so and currently still do so.

Allowing the small trader to hold only a few shares, “scheduled maintenance” in the middle of the day (which stop you from trading at your will), and never ending glitches devised to scare the average small time trader into thinking their holding are worthless are the mark of a company bent on controlling the will of the public to profit the reckless and greedy companies of Wall Street. For so long they’ve garnered the reputation of the one company the small time trader could trust to NOT screw them over; however, it seems all that time was only posturing by Wall Street to create a buffer zone so as to protect their bottom end should such an occasion rise... Such an occasion did rise and millions in damages were seen my many, but of course not by those on Wall Street.

Given the quality of an app’s support can either make or break the user experience, especially for an app like this one, where should you encounter an issue and need in-person help, there is no physical location you can go to, as you would with a bank - it is incredibly unfortunate that Robinhood’s quality of support is as deficient and unusable as it is.

To have “a clean chart” the information you choose displayed in a way that’s easy to visually digest. If your chart gets “to busy” then datapoints you have chosen to be displayed get absorbed into the background of your chart and they end up missed or overlooked . Robinhood displays the information in the most clean and easy to digest way; while Webull comes off as more advanced  I’d really argue it’s busy and/or messy and that Robinhood has all the same features and function of Webull minus the feeds (social aspect) Of webull plus having a Roth IRA option with a 1% match on funds is a deal sweetener for sure… so is the spending section/account and the bank-ish features and services that it offers not.

If Robinhood is able to cite legal statutes (e.g. from the SEC) to justify their actions I will consider retracting my statement although at this point it is likely they have already partially achieved their goal of limiting some losses to high-risk short sellers.

I use them mostly for the easy access to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but with what was previously Robinhood's greatest benefit (zero commissions) becoming the norm across much of the retail brokerage industry, I seldom use it for much else beyond crypto.

Coming from someone with experience using Interactive Brokers' app and desktop software, ThinkOrSwim, Schwab's app and desktop software, and who has regular access to a Bloomberg terminal, I can tell you the Robinhood app is nothing special. The way orders are entered is probably helpful for newer market participants, but I find it cumbersome and drawn out as someone with more experience (I don't need to go through 2-4 different screens just to say I want a limit buy order for X quantity at Y price!).

Probably my biggest gripe, however, has to do with the price charts. To say they are lacking in quality, detail, and functionality would be an understatement.

Overall, Robinhood is an ok brokerage that makes it very easy to open up an account and start trading or investing, but with the playing field in terms of zero commissions having been leveled and other firms offering much better options in terms of their technology and customer service, I think it's worth your time to look around once you have some experience.",2

I would not use an online shopping ad that suddenly stopped letting people buy cookies because they can make people fat; and had I known Robinhood could suddenly deny everyone the right to buy stocks through its app “in light of recent volatility” I would have never held my money with them. I do not know whether Robinhood’s motivation for this act was some ill-conceived attempt to “protect”its retail users or an attempt to manipulate markets in favor of institutional investors, but neither is acceptable nor in line with their alleged mission.",1

Billionaires have been controlling the stock market for hundreds of years such as Nathan Rothschild scaring the London exchange by falsely claiming Napoleon had defeated the British in the Battle of Waterloo, or Jamie Dimon exacerbating the housing market crash in 2008 causing millions of families to go homeless while making billions in the process. Robinhood places restrictions merely because billionaire hedge fund managers bet against these stocks and we the people bet for them increasing their value and the hedge fund managers who bet against them to go into deficit.

The news feed, also, although it does provide articles on companies you have expressed interest in, appears to be mostly pushing tech stocks and cryptocurrency although I have never had the slightest interest in these, while not providing any information on other sectors I am highly invested in beyond stocks I have already bought or put on a list. The bottom line is that while Robinhood is a great place to buy your stock, it is not the place to get information on what stock to buy. Do your research elsewhere, then take advantage of this easy, nearly cost free platform for your purchases.",4

I have decided to move to another trading platform after witnessing Robinhood’s market manipulation tactics in supporting hedge funds and punishing individuals by removing certain stocks from being purchased, but continuing to allow them to be sold. This creates an imbalance in supply and demand by completely eradicating demand and thus forcing individuals with a position in these stocks to lose on their positions. Throughout this “Robinhood blackout period”, hedge funds have been able to buy and sell these stocks. This imbalance is the very premise of Robinhood’s mission of making securities more accessible, but it is clear that this is simply a misleading facade to attract users.",1

d1a40ec1-aa8c-4a73-8498-aa7ebb5801b9,2022-07-21 20:03:27,"I had an open credit call spread for SPY that was expiring in less than 30 minutes, about $1.50 out of the money (for those uninitiated: unless SPY saw significant movement very quickly, I was golden). Then some bozo on their risk management team closed my position for a loss of nearly $2,000 despite the fact that I had plenty of collateral to cover the trades.  

In conversation with three folks from their support team, they all agreed that there was little risk to my position, there was virtually no chance of me losing more money than I had committed as collateral, two indicated that they are currently looking to change their policies so that such things don't happen in the future, and yet there was zero chance of any kind of remediation.

They are unilaterally making assessments about risk that have very little basis in reality and that they KNOW are based on bad criteria, as they are looking to change them. Incredibly incredibly frustrating. I should have paid more attention to everyone decrying them over the last couple years.

(As a further element you may want to be aware of: through talking to support I was even told that they would automatically close a credit  put spread that looked like it might get pinned, even though the risk involved there is essentially nonexistent. I can't imagine how frustrated I would have been if that had happened. I have zero trust in them.)",1

Stock investing with no fees is amazing and I couldn’t have imagined it any other way: thanks Robinhood. Overall the app is fairly ease for the average person to sue, simple, and the animations and graphics are nice. Some suggestions: - Add the three major indexes in the browse page. - Rework how dividends are shown, a breakdown by year/quarter/month and by companies/ETFs would be great. - More information available for stocks without gold: payout ratio, beta, PEG ratio, P/S ratio, P/B ratio. - Additional cryptos would be nice (Cardano, Polygon, Polkadot, Solana).",4

GME was not the only stock that they did this on. This cost me money on another stock. It’s okay for investors to get rich by reading the market and manipulation but it’s not okay when poor or everyday people do it. NOT OKAY.

Robinhood allows ethical, more democratic capitalism to flourish and more ensures companies that the public enjoys gets the support they're due, like Tesla and Apple and such. Many believe that having too many individuals being able to trade so easily ""gamifies"" the market making it more like just gambling, but the benefits of these services far outweigh the negatives. Robinhood recently turned off the ""buy"" button on some stocks sort-of like how the exchange can limit trades in a stock market plunge, but I believe these actions should have much more regulation and guidance out out by the company before they do anything like that in the future. Robinhood is a great start to absolute public trading, but just like many things in capitalism, it needs clear left and right limits before people trust it more.",4

On the constructive criticism front, I would love to have more cryptocurrencies available, especially ADA. I also think it would be great to include LINK, VET, DOT, ATOM, ONE, THETA & any other blockchain that has great technology behind it. Currently, the offerings like Ethereum Classic (which is almost a dead project as Hoskinson is working on ADA) and DOGE (which is really a meme coin, and has pumped, but offers no real technology advancement) and all the Bitcoin forks don’t really reflect the blockchain revolution that is upon us. I think you should think of it more like blockchain technology assets and list the coins with great tech accordingly. Currently, I think you only offer 2 of those, BTC and ETH.",5
