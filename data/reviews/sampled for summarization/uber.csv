b76ffcd9-29a3-40e9-bfb7-fdd8bc3eaa30,2023-05-06 18:08:01,was calling customer service due to a very bad glitch on their own app gets paired with the worst customer service person ever where they didnt know what they were talking about was literally no help what so ever kept repeating things even though i explained everything in more then enough complete detail they also kept hanging up on me (also not the first time this has happened as well where they kept hanging up on me repeatedly) when the app was being super buggy they refused to help me any further let alone at all and just seems uber themselves just kept protectng this employee who was clearly not cut out for customer service let alone any form of customer service and in my opinion they honestly should be fired in all honesty otherwise leaving this as a 1 star review until uber can fix this issue at hand and preferably fire the employee in question is more then willing to change this review into a more positive one if uber themselves can fix this issue properly along with preferably firing the employee in question if they can also do that as like i said this person in paticular should not be working in this line of customer service let alone any form of customer service at all and its honestly a shame uber is willing to protect even the lowest of their employees who were in the wrong to begin with as is,1

b9b4f2cf-cee7-4cd5-a86b-0340aaefcee9,2023-09-24 04:09:17,I would’ve gave them five out of four stars but the only reason why I’m only giving four is because sometimes there isMoments where you don’t get your food and you’re telling them you didn’t get your food and they make you pay for the meal anyways cause it has happened to me a few times especially with a few that were very large orders like I paid over $70 $100 and then I said I didn’t get it and then nothing and I pay for their subscription every month so you think that I would be more of a loyal customer driving business knows that it’s all about Customer satisfactoryI hope that it doesn’t continue to keep happening more often because it if it would then that would be a disappointment for me in Uber because I would not be using their services anymore because I like everything else but I’m not gonna be ripped off sometimes because they think that they know what happened or I’m lying or stereotyping or who knows dad but true but that’s the only negative I would say everything else has been pretty positive and has been pretty smooth with Uber other than the issue of not getting food or not getting money back or something along those lines,4

It is ridiculous that the Uber driver didn’t know the route - Instead of taking Springfield/Franconia exit 644 he kept on driving on I-95 south and finally took the Franconia exit that added at least 6-7 miles and 12 minutes to the ride Under no circumstances I am going to pay more for a ride that took longer time/driving distance due to driver errors",1

After the experience, these things are very annoying and Uber must solve them.",3

The app either has to recruit more people( I don’t believe they have strict policies as I have ridden twice with smokers and even smelt hash in the Uber) so they look like pretty flexible with who can join their fleet 
However, it is a problem to find an Uber in Jeddah 
It is basically a hit or miss depending on your luck that day 
I am going to look for another riding app (maybe a local one would be more reliable)",2
7b53d82e-0b9a-4a5a-bf06-0e869a7c9002,2022-11-15 07:57:53,"In Jordan drivers just cancel the ride once they reach you when they found the trip is short or the payment is credit card or for any other reason 

It happened to me many times, and why is that, because they can do that under the reason of customer is not wearing mask, although I was wearing one and despite the fact that it is not required any more 

One time I was already in the car and the moment I got on and put the seat belt, the driver received a call, and easily told me sorry I have to be somewhere else, then in front of me he just put in the app that I am not wearing a mask and said sorry someone else will come now to pick you up

And guess what, you can’t claim that, no way you can do that, I spent hours in the app trying to do that, it is designed not to

So in Jordan I don’t recommend using uber",1

The first driver is very close 
But never arrives
No messages, excuses or explanations 
Just no show 
Until a second driver suddenly appears from the cloud 
And normally arrives after 5 to 15 min 
Also no explanations, because apparently they don’t know what happened to the first driver 

I opted out LYFT, because the first driver never showed up and also refused to give up on the trip 
Because the knew that the client will  call it off and will be charged with not waiting for the driver 

Hope this will not be the future of Uber

Now as i am writing this i am currently in my Uber i have been in this Uber for 26 min a ride that takes 15 min because Uber had the driver take the longest way ANDDD it’s map legit took it down a road that you can’t even turn onto, to get to my destination and it’s not the first time, so all and all Uber it’s self needs to work on that.",3

However the games management play with their customers and drivers is HORRIBLE 
the prices fluctuate by the minute 
As I am usually loyal to 1 company 
I find at times I have to check prices at LYFT 
when the price of a ride from UBER is $89 and I check LYFT at the same time and it’s $65 then I have a problem spending my hard earned money with UBER 
Next the amount they pass on to the driver is kind of unfair 
When they started UBER drivers got a lot more and as time goes on now they give the drivers even less
Can it just be CORPORATE GREED ?
I do realize the Airports and municipalities are probably getting 
Their hands into UBERs pockets 
Which is really a HIDDEN THEFT
by politics 
Really a hidden TAX
because ultimately the end user 
Pays it indirectly 
Oh well just saying my thoughts",1

This was an easy fix, should be as easy as contacting Uber, showing my bank history and then my ride history so they could see I never got the ride, I send a message to Uber and after three days of arguing I got told that the charge was for a trip I took over a month ago, then I send them my bank history to show I was indeed charged in time for that and this was a different charge, long story short, after three days of fighting i got an Uber gift card smaller than the amount that I payed to begin with, to be honest, get Lyft, it’s cheaper, faster, and iver all better",2

Their Uber drivers were not allowed inside the general station area as other local taxi drivers were allowed to do. I see this as being bias toward one fleet of operators such as Uber. This is an annual systemic problem here for Uber drivers and should really be addressed to the mayor and governors office while other local taxi’s are allow inside Old San Juan many of these drivers look like people from a 3rd world county that cannot take on a normal conversation and suspecting that they are illegitimate taxi operators, something smell fishy here which I suspect that many of the taxi operators are leasing their operating licenses to immigrants. In addition there is no transparency and usually wanted to charge me double the price for my commute from Old San Juan to Isla Verde Another concerning issue is that many of the municipal buses at the Old San Juan Depot stop operating at 9:00 pm during the San Sabastian Festival that lingers on until 12:00 minight or so, doesn’t make much sense to me as you have hundreds of thousand people and tourist here to enjoy the festivities.

2) 3rd party ride arrangers (hospital. rental car..) rides = zero tip 100% of times; not fair since the riders don’t have ‘skin’ in the game. Also how should we rate the rider if it was arranged by a 3rd party
3) The idea of drivers providing an instant rating for the riders is not fair. After providing an excellent service and not getting a tip, how should we rate that without knowing 
4) When using destination and long pickup is accepted (> 6 miles) a long pickup fee for distance and time is not added which is wrong. Driver is still driving a long distance to the rider even if it is on my way home or when I try to reach a busier area
5) There should be an overall option for the driver to select how far he/she is willing to drive for a given ride as a maximum so proposed drives will not result as rejected
6) The popup screen with proposed rides has small font size for crucial ride/distance information and should be bigger so it can be read

Just if you’re in Dallas and you need to go get beer get your Uber and over with before 1130 something like 1115 or 10 o’clock to places are closing earlier these days so I would even suggest after work or 7 PM or something and schedule of the trip back if there’s nothing else because that’s always fun to do from the backseat when you don’t have your reading glasses lol.

• Dropoff

I paid for the two stops because I was grabbing frozen items and didn’t want to walk the rest of the way home because it was 115 degrees outside. The Uber driver just left and finished the trip while I was in the store, forcing me to walk the rest of the way home and when I contacted customer support they said there was nothing they could do so I just decided to stop all Uber usage on my end, and decided to make a comment to help others avoid these issues.)",2

My most recent interaction with them was having them sign me up for a monthly uber pass subscription without my knowledge (even though I use their app maybe twice a year), charging me $10 a month for it for 6 months, refusing to refund me afterwards, then charging me it for 2 more months even after their support had sworn it wouldn't happen again.

My problems with user interface are more focused on support than the drivers: there’s no way to call and talk to an actual person to resolve an issue and the prompts on the help tab can only do so much.

I am fully aware that there are some costs associated with running Iber by Uber.
There is a problem when a client pays for service $34 and driver gets $19
Why?  Because that is 55% driver / 45% uber split
That is INSANE and a robbery of both a client and a driver, so the Uber can fill their pockets.
Not sure what else Uner offers other than the car ride app platform, as the drivers have their own insurance, and im fairly sure that both prties are left on their own in case of soemthing going wrong.
Im not bitter, just a bit dissapointed that uber used to collect 20% fee for their service, which i thought was very fair, and yet the corporate greed won again with time

Uber’s GPS yells the drivers to go up/down on the two highways, the way they do in Bombay or the Middle East, where the old cities were not built for fast car travel, but Manhattan was built on a grid for fast horses and horse-drawn carriages. Many avenues were a direct shoot. It was unfortunate that city planners have been ignorant and from other countries and made blockage at the diagonal B R O A D way so that has become dysfunctional. 
STILL depending on traffic time of the day and day of the week, moth and year, the quickest way up and down remains to be through the city streets in a zig zag. But now most of the drivers are not from Manhattan  don’t know it’s traffic patterns. Have no desire to learn, nor do dispatchers have any inclination or knowledge to brief them…they all rely on a less than perfect program and the dumbest one to boot — the Uber GPS for Manhattan🥹",1

The first thing I noticed is the prices for rides were significantly cheaper as I have been constantly comparing the two before traveling from one destination to the other. The other aspect that’s HUGE for me when it comes to ride-share is the fact that I am able to get a ride sent to my location in less than 10 minutes compared to waiting anywhere from 10-25 minutes with the other guys in most cases. Now keep in mind with the competition you receive a lower rate when you choose to wait longer on a ride and even then Uber still comes out to a lower fare without the terrible wait time, so with all that being said I have to say that Uber is definitely the way to go in my opinion if you are looking for better pricing and quicker pickup times 👍🏼",5

App will calculate prices in a sketchy manner which usually favors Uber (even with discounted rides).

Car quality is unpredictable (vans that only open/close doors SLOW by driver or dirty clear curtain to prevent covid germs to driver).

Not fair to the drivers, also not paying them for gas as they should, they’re getting paid way less than what they use to and that wasn’t even enough (I’m just a rider , not a driver myself I don’t even have a car hence all the rides I take , but being in all the Ubers and Lyfts  I have I talk to many drivers about the pros and cons of their jobs and you’d be so surprised by a lot of what they tell you ) Uber needs to do better honestly, they make WAYY to much money to be running things the way they are .

Instead of having to order 3 separate times for 1 coffee, then salad, then halal shawarma within the same plaza only for 3 different delivery guys to take those items to get to the one requester is a waste of time and resources and not eco friendly. It’s also pathetic Uber won’t allow users to request orders without tipping. It’s self contradicting the fact Uber doesn’t pay the delivery contractors a fair share. Everyone knows Uber takes in 1000% plus in profit per transaction whether Uber ride or subscriptions etc. So be more egalitarian Uber give Uber employees and contractors equitable share of profit — forcing paying customers to tip is pathetic. I also wish I can get points or use points in my Starbucks or Legal C orders, if the app can allow one sign on to these different food platforms. Pros: I do like the group order option, easy for individuals with diet restrictions to place their own food orders. And I like being able to see Starbucks order images similar to the Starbucks app or pictures and ingredient details to a pho restaurant etc. Thanks!!!",3

I've been using uber for a while now and a common issue ive seen with drivers is the map view. The issue is not knowing that you can change the perspective of the map by clicking on the navigation arrow on the bottom right to zoom in on the map to change the view for when driving. The navigation arrow button that you press to change the view is the challenge. Alot of drivers dont know to press it so they stay in the high birds eye view and have trouble navigating because it doesn't show the street by street images. 

Best,
