"suggestions for widget for amount user have: updated automatically periodically
suggestion for deposit cash into ATMs without needing primary checking account outside of Acorn: ",acorn,5/25/20222:53:00 PM,3,"I love Acorns & I’ve been using it with contentment for a while now. I have some ideas/recommendations that seem reasonably simple to engineer and would result in lots of love from the Acorns community!! (By the way I only marked it 3 stars so the devs would see) 1. It would be great if the Widget for Acorns Spend updated every couple of seconds so that users can see how much they have without having to open the app and type in their password. I doubt it would be seen as a privacy violation considering that the only people that it would have an effect on would have previously chosen to have their balance on their Home Screen. 2. I think that if the Acorns GUI was customizable then people could be more conscious of their spending. For example, milestones appear before round ups, which seems counterintuitive considering that people care less about the future (milestones) than the present (roundups / what may be coming out of their bank account in the near future) 3. This one is less achievable and understandably difficult because of the banking infrastructures we have in the US, but it has bugged me a bit and I think it would be a significant improvement to the UX if Acorns users were able to deposit cash into ATMs instead of having to use their primary checking account outside of Acorns to fund their spend/invest/early accounts… this would give working class users who make a trade-based living and deal primarily with cash more access to investing. It would also provide older people with the ability to invest their money in a way that they are used to, considering that cash is used far more often by the elderly. This might be considered a stretch but it would also help auto-immune disabled users who aim to make the least amount of physical and potentially dangerous contact with others.

checking account with saving goals: missing in Acorn",acorn,5/21/20224:32:00 PM,4,"Acorns is an almost flawless investing app, and I would have given it 5 stars if not for a few minor (but rather inconvenient) issues.
First the good:
If you’re bad at saving money like me, this is the app for you. I have an above average knowledge of stocks and Acorns strategy of investing in diversified indexes is great. The fact that they repeatedly emphasize a buy and hold strategy is great too, and a LOT of my age group in their 20’s and 30’s need to hear this. Time in the market >> timing the market, and Acorns takes advantage of this strategy to a T. While the lack of customization for holdings may be a put off to some, most successful investors have portfolios very similar to Acorns. 

Their checking account is a must have for round ups which are so crucial in passive investing. And their debit card feels nice in your hand and is great to use. I only wish it had a touch to pay feature which is very common on new cards

And their customer service is beyond amazing. Prompt with replies and extremely helpful, they really help set this app apart from others.

Now for the bad:
If there’s any area in which Acorns will lose out to other apps, it’s the lack of a high yield savings account and saving strategies to keep a more liquid portion of your cash saved for more short term expenses. Take betterment for example, and their savings goals, which allows you to save money for a rainy day AND invest. Apps like So-Fi and Digit have similar strategies. I need to have a separate checking account with savings goals in order to maintain rainy day savings that are kept separate from my spending account, since acorns doesn’t offer this. 
Im a firm believer that not every dollar you save should be invested, and instead investors need to have a certain amount of money (6-8 months of living expenses) in liquid to tide over rough spells. If this current bear market thought us anything, it’s the fact that everyone needs a safety buffer. Im surprised Acorns missed this important point. Maybe they overlooked a savings account or maybe they just didn’t feel the need to offer one.
I just do hope they read this and consider adding one so I can make do with one place to store my money and not have to transfer funds separately into Acorns to spend 

Otherwise this is a brilliant app. Keep up the good work.",992b2eea-3af9-410a-afa3-e3818b40109c

have very SOOTHING AND MYSTICAL
VOICES!!Some of the stories also have very soothing mystical background ….(some musical and some sounds of nature) I would love for the volume to be elevated because they add to the soothing effects of the stories!! I was so IMPRESSED with Glacier Express that I am SERIOUSLY thinking about visiting The Swiss Alps!! I thought I would have liked A Very Sleepy Burns Night Dennis Lawson …..has a very soothing voice but he recited the poetry using a VERY HEAVY SCOTTISH ACCENT with singsong tempo that I found RATHER ANNOYING!!
I also wish you could add more hour long stories when I am having a real hard time falling asleep! 💤 
A reviewer complained about famous celebrities narrating the stories which really didn’t bother me though I prefer lesser known ones to narrate!! I was Exceptionally impressed that pop singer Shawn Mendescould narrate a sleep story with such VERVE AND EMOTION

Especially when you look at the inflation rises we are facing at this time! Thinking along that same line, paying for the app such amounts, I should NOT have to tolerate all the tracking you are doing, especially the amount that identifies me! Paying you for the app ANY APP FOR THAT MATTER should automatically relieve me of being tracked identifiably!!! You developers have long started taking too much liberty with a user’s privacy! You don’t need all that personally identifiable information for your app to work now, do you? I still treasure my privacy! I should AT LEAST have an option to turn off any tracking I truly don’t want.you certainly are the only developer who is taking too far. You aren’t even one of the worst privacy abusers. Some devs track everything, even sensitive or other information that is nebulously explained as simply sensitive or other information. That sounds like maybe hidden canmmeras are running as we step from the shower, or worse! Then, “make us pay for the rape!” You aren’t the worst privacy thieves, but you certainly can help clean up this environment! Would you please consider the lifetime payment option AND at least allow options on the tracking items? I would rather, however,if you just weren’t so noseyin the first place! Perhaps then your app would have a chance at five stars! Lastly, I pray this app is fully accessible to blind, low vision, and other disabled people! I hope I can just breeze through using your app!

" daily streaks: helpful
track meditation minutes: helpful
meditation practice habits: easy to track and conduct meditation",headspace,7/30/20221:32:00 AM,5,"About seven years ago, I was in the most consistent meditation practice of my life, meditating twice a day every day for 15-30 minutes. Looking back, this practice helped cultivate the most inner peace and stability I’ve ever felt. I’ve fallen on and off the bandwagon since, but this app has sincerely helped me get back on track in such an easy way. It is designed to help people who may feel uncomfortable with the idea of mediation, to help those who think they’re “doing it wrong” or for those who have trouble sitting still or in silence. I think a lot of people misunderstand the “point” of meditation; Headspace does well to illustrate that the point is to slow down an overactive mind so that we can observe, but not attach ourselves to, the deluge of thoughts in order to create inner space so that you can see the world around you more clearly and without judgment. Additionally, Headspace keeps track of the minutes you’ve spent meditating and the daily streak of checking in, which are just little things that help to make us feel good about the time we’ve spent and to make it a little easier to hold ourselves accountable for taking care of ourselves. Whether you are prone to depression or anxiety, have difficulties falling asleep, trouble managing your priorities or letting anger get the best of you, among many other issues people face on a daily basis, there is a mediation (often several!) that, with CONSISTENT practice, will help to minimize those difficulties in daily life.

Previously, I was just using the same recording over and over again, which got stale. With Headspace, the experience becomes familiar (in that you go through the same steps every day) while allowing me to develop curiosity by being exposed to the new concepts that help me refine the approach right away (a little like training wheels).

customer support: not good, better with other firms
price charts: lacking in detail, quality and functionality",robinhood,3/22/20218:01:00 PM,2,"The app and Robinhood as a brokerage are ok, though not great. I use them mostly for the easy access to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but with what was previously Robinhood's greatest benefit (zero commissions) becoming the norm across much of the retail brokerage industry, I seldom use it for much else beyond crypto.

Coming from someone with experience using Interactive Brokers' app and desktop software, ThinkOrSwim, Schwab's app and desktop software, and who has regular access to a Bloomberg terminal, I can tell you the Robinhood app is nothing special. The way orders are entered is probably helpful for newer market participants, but I find it cumbersome and drawn out as someone with more experience (I don't need to go through 2-4 different screens just to say I want a limit buy order for X quantity at Y price!).

Probably my biggest gripe, however, has to do with the price charts. To say they are lacking in quality, detail, and functionality would be an understatement.

Overall, Robinhood is an ok brokerage that makes it very easy to open up an account and start trading or investing, but with the playing field in terms of zero commissions having been leveled and other firms offering much better options in terms of their technology and customer service, I think it's worth your time to look around once you have some experience.",672df48c-9996-4f8f-92f2-6b8a0d4dda08

Robinhood recently turned off the ""buy"" button on some stocks sort-of like how the exchange can limit trades in a stock market plunge, but I believe these actions should have much more regulation and guidance out out by the company before they do anything like that in the future.

3) The idea of drivers providing an instant rating for the riders is not fair. After providing an excellent service and not getting a tip, how should we rate that without knowing 
4) When using destination and long pickup is accepted (> 6 miles) a long pickup fee for distance and time is not added which is wrong. Driver is still driving a long distance to the rider even if it is on my way home or when I try to reach a busier area
5) There should be an overall option for the driver to select how far he/she is willing to drive for a given ride as a maximum so proposed drives will not result as rejected

"Bumble BFF features works for heterosexual people: since it matches the same gender for making new friends
Bumble BFF feature not working for cis-identifying queer people: ",bumble,3/24/202212:51:00 AM,2,"Bumble BFF inherently recognizes that people need to make friends, new friends. This is especially crucial when for example you move or enter a period of new growth. And BFF inherently recognizes that people sometimes are solely looking for friends where sex can never be an option and harassment is a nonstarter, hence it limits matches only to the same gender. That only works for heterosexual people, and there is no way to change that setting. Cis-identifying queer people have no way of seeking platonic friendships safe from the risk of harassment or sexual pressure. And the utilization of the binary completely removes choice and sense of belonging for trans and non-binary folx for whom harassment and sexual pressure are never off the table anyways.

In short, why is the platonic side of this app geared first and foremost with cis-hets in mind, with virtually no liberty for queer people? Do we not deserve friends of our own choosing? Are we inherently incapable of making lasting and deep friendships with others of different gender identities?? Bumble BFF answers the latter two questions with a resounding YES.

Just seems a bit selective and fishy to me now that Ive been researching for a bit and have seen that many women and trans people have also been unexplainably banned. Tinder is ok with outwardly stating they allow registered sex offenders to be on this app but then seem to not be willing to publically address this reoccurring problem that seems to be continuously swept under the rug... like literally I was swiping fine and pretty last night and was talking to a few men and then i open my phone this morning and see that im banned lol... like i literally read over all the guidelines and i coudlnt even think of anything I did that would have even applied to anything they had written... someone has to do something about this and please give me my account back!

fake accounts: ",tinder,9/22/2022 21:45,1,"They created a decent app (not without its problems) and sue to recent global happenings dating has become extremely reliant on online apps. Then without question or any form of appeal or at minimum a discussion they can block you from any type of online dating… yes I understand there are other options… but when the parent company owns the top 10 dating apps you get blocked from all of them. And they give you the run around with zero help or process to help. And how convenient they banned me 1 week after they renewed my membership (which continues to go up in price every few months.) And even worse they choose to ban people randomly without warning or anything… while anybody that’s spent more than 3 minutes on the app knows the vitriol on here but nothing is done about that… the amount of people using it just to promote paying for sex, only fans, or scam fake accounts… but they randomly ban people without warning or any explanation is baffling. Sad state of affairs that everything has become. I guess I should thank Tinder for allowing me that 1-2 hours back I’ve been wasting using their app. Tinder single handedly by poor management will bring back in person dating.",8a79f82e-9175-4456-8e52-839cd6c561ef

I just feel insulted to be told by the app that gaming isn’t a hobby, so I must fall into one of three categories, either I play Fortnite, league of legends, or both.

account ban:,tinder,6/9/2022 20:49,3,I like Tinder so far but it’s a lot of exclusions on the app because I have a Nonbinary friend who’s a guy who was banned last year simply because he was matching with guys and that’s not fair in my opinion because he wasn’t breaking a rule or policy. Now if the guys weren’t interested in him that was fine but that’s no reason for tinder to ban him simply because male users said ban him. My thing is that if a male user or female user is nonbinary or bisexual or pansexual They should have the right to match with anyone regardless of their sexuality or gender because if the person isn’t into them that’s fine but TINDER SHOULD NOT BAN THEM BECAUSE USERS DONT LIKE THEM.,3f1f467c-d290-4655-a175-22e2a436b946
