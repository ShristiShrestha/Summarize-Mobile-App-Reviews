eda1fc5c-0106-4ffa-91c0-e73178f7af75,2022-01-08 02:20:47,Love this app it forces me to save BIG and invest daily with a touch of a button or set automatic to do it...... that’s fire 🔥 👌👍...I use all the features that come With the app the only thing I found that could be better is the costumer service part for some reason I like to speak to a person and handle the issues quick when it comes to transferring money into accounts and retirement plans when I have a question 🤔etc.......the email thing back and forth just delays the process and my questions get answered late I don’t like the waiting 1 to 2 days for a answer 🤷‍♂️..........Besides that i can truly say it’s a amazing tool to use I don’t think I would’ve ever started a ROTH IRA or change my ways of saving and spending if it wasn’t for this app.....ACORN 2050 the futures bright lol,5
0302b00a-faa2-4f6e-9bdb-95076dd27e0f,2022-06-11 00:14:51,I started a dispute because someone stole card and pin and ID and they locked me out of my account until they “investigated” the dispute I couldn’t pay my bills I was late on my rent and car payment because I couldn’t access my money if you use them as only Investments then it’s pretty good but do not rely on them for your main checking account they do not work like regular banks always have a checking account with a physical bank because every other bank I have had people use my card or disputed a charge they would give me a temporary debit card and I was still able to use my money they didn’t keep my money hostage like acorns checking.,1

I had all my referrals in before the deadline date and made sure that all my referrals made a 1 time investment because I sent all of them $10 to make sure they did it, what acorn did was waited til the deadline date was over to process my referrals then I wrote a email about it they responded saying the system was backed up by all the entries amd that they were dealing with the problem but managed to complete 3 of my referrals that same day then when I wrote a email again about it they responded basically telling me the requirements for the referrals to be completed which I knew and made sure my ppl invested now it’s a month later an they just now completed the other 2 referrals so o called those 2 ppl to see if they did anything to they account recently and they responded with a no so acorn waited til the date was past due to complete all the referrals and that’s how I didn’t get my bonus because of them",1

86efb7dd-434f-4f73-8253-623540949bc6,2022-07-12 22:56:44,I started trying to save money n invest then I stopped for awhile just for reasons and after I stopped recurring every Friday for a bit it started taking 5$ away from my bank account without it being recurring so I deleted it so it wouldn’t steal money from me- yeah 5$ ain’t much but when it’s over n over n over I think they just want my money- especially when the money they took didn’t get invested for my acorns account- probably close to 50-60 bucks just gone and didn’t even try to get it back- why? What’s the point I can just invest in a different app that doesn’t take money without asking and not using that money for my investment account which is ridiculous- every time a 5 was deducted I checked acorns and nothing was there every time plus i was a new user at the time so I think it was a bad app for investing unless you want your money taken then sure be my guest. I don’t know if anyone else noticed this but yes if you turn off recurring bill for any amount of 5-20 per week it will start to take it out of your account for no reason and it won’t even be there in your acorns account- sorry but I aint downloading this again if that happens- hope someone sees this✌️ in the end don’t trust most things people say that’s all,1

It is important to recognize that investment choices are not determined by gender but by individual preferences, financial circumstances, and access to resources.

was told 4 different times that a supervisor would call me (still haven’t gotten the call),

A few “malfunctioning” referral links later (through the Acorns referral bonus program) and I have unfortunately lost both my enthusiasm and trust in Acorns.

What should be a simple referral process did not correctly capture four very close friends’ referred accounts and although I attempted to be patient and assume the best, I grew frustrated with the continued follow-up required only to be emailed what seems to be a template advising no one could help and that I should reach out again if I had additional questions. I gave Acorns the benefit of the doubt the first and second time this happened, but it became quite clear by the fourth time there was a referral issue that there is no incentive for Acorns customer support to fix the “broken referral link” issue - especially once your friend or family’s account is opened. 

I called and emailed much more than I would have liked to and was surprised at how unpleasant the referral bonus process has become but ultimately leaving this review for the benefit of other users who go through the efforts of referring friends and family. I did speak to a supervisor to advise that it feels the referral bonus program is set up for us to fail somewhere along the way. I successfully completed referral bonuses in the past, but the previous two referral bonus periods have changed for the worse compared to the originally simple process.

Would be great if this small review helps the product team recognize a product deficiency and address this referral bonus issue for the benefit of loyal Acorns users.",1

I only discovered this on my own while exploring the app: it didn't tell me that it accessed five separate accounts from one account & routing number. Worse, when I tried to cancel the automatic investments, it wanted me to authenticate my checking account with a transaction that hadn't happened yet, so I would have to wait 3 business days before I could cancel a weekly withdrawal that presumably would have happened before then. After canceling and deleting everything I could find, I can only hope they won't rob my proper investments.

a80623b8-d620-45e4-ac8f-2fa120d7ad0b,2022-05-25 14:53:15,"I love Acorns & I’ve been using it with contentment for a while now. I have some ideas/recommendations that seem reasonably simple to engineer and would result in lots of love from the Acorns community!! (By the way I only marked it 3 stars so the devs would see) 1. It would be great if the Widget for Acorns Spend updated every couple of seconds so that users can see how much they have without having to open the app and type in their password. I doubt it would be seen as a privacy violation considering that the only people that it would have an effect on would have previously chosen to have their balance on their Home Screen. 2. I think that if the Acorns GUI was customizable then people could be more conscious of their spending. For example, milestones appear before round ups, which seems counterintuitive considering that people care less about the future (milestones) than the present (roundups / what may be coming out of their bank account in the near future) 3. This one is less achievable and understandably difficult because of the banking infrastructures we have in the US, but it has bugged me a bit and I think it would be a significant improvement to the UX if Acorns users were able to deposit cash into ATMs instead of having to use their primary checking account outside of Acorns to fund their spend/invest/early accounts… this would give working class users who make a trade-based living and deal primarily with cash more access to investing. It would also provide older people with the ability to invest their money in a way that they are used to, considering that cash is used far more often by the elderly. This might be considered a stretch but it would also help auto-immune disabled users who aim to make the least amount of physical and potentially dangerous contact with others.

It doesn’t matter how bad the market (or their algorithm) is, their charts always shows you an uptick, like it’s going great.  The reason they do this is to show the money that you’re personally putting in is increasing but it doesn’t actually show you the performance of the portfolio. Other competitor services such as Wealthfront show the $ value of your investment as the cash investment as well as another line to show how your portfolio is performing relative to the $ you deposited. Wealthfront is much more honest service in this regard.  

Secondly if you contact customer service )if you’re lucky to even be able to get reach them) on email they ask you to send back private information which is easily intercepted/hackable and can be used to impersonate you. Specifically they asked for your date of birth call Mary address on file with the email address and the phone number I don’t know of any other financial services or Fintech operations to ask for this over email. Good financial firms and security experts advise against sending this sensitive information over email. If Acorns would say to me here “we’re sorry you feel that way, please contact customer service” that’s complete waste of time I have advised them of this on numerous occasions and they have done sweet FA over a number of years. So I’m forced to write in a public forum. Perhaps if you care about your security and if you care about an accurate charting where you can measure yours and their performance then choose another provider.",2

992b2eea-3af9-410a-afa3-e3818b40109c,2022-05-21 16:32:40,"Acorns is an almost flawless investing app, and I would have given it 5 stars if not for a few minor (but rather inconvenient) issues.
First the good:
If you’re bad at saving money like me, this is the app for you. I have an above average knowledge of stocks and Acorns strategy of investing in diversified indexes is great. The fact that they repeatedly emphasize a buy and hold strategy is great too, and a LOT of my age group in their 20’s and 30’s need to hear this. Time in the market >> timing the market, and Acorns takes advantage of this strategy to a T. While the lack of customization for holdings may be a put off to some, most successful investors have portfolios very similar to Acorns. 

Their checking account is a must have for round ups which are so crucial in passive investing. And their debit card feels nice in your hand and is great to use. I only wish it had a touch to pay feature which is very common on new cards

And their customer service is beyond amazing. Prompt with replies and extremely helpful, they really help set this app apart from others.

Now for the bad:
If there’s any area in which Acorns will lose out to other apps, it’s the lack of a high yield savings account and saving strategies to keep a more liquid portion of your cash saved for more short term expenses. Take betterment for example, and their savings goals, which allows you to save money for a rainy day AND invest. Apps like So-Fi and Digit have similar strategies. I need to have a separate checking account with savings goals in order to maintain rainy day savings that are kept separate from my spending account, since acorns doesn’t offer this. 
Im a firm believer that not every dollar you save should be invested, and instead investors need to have a certain amount of money (6-8 months of living expenses) in liquid to tide over rough spells. If this current bear market thought us anything, it’s the fact that everyone needs a safety buffer. Im surprised Acorns missed this important point. Maybe they overlooked a savings account or maybe they just didn’t feel the need to offer one.
I just do hope they read this and consider adding one so I can make do with one place to store my money and not have to transfer funds separately into Acorns to spend 

Otherwise this is a brilliant app. Keep up the good work.",4
e96c3a66-680d-4130-8a9d-33555eacb1fa,2022-09-19 15:06:57,"The Acorns model seems really great. I’ve had an account for several years now and had decent dividends. Last year they had some sort of major glitch in which most accounts (if not all) were sent an email saying their account was locked, followed by an unprofessional email stating that their account was not locked. I contacted Acorns immediately to find out if there had been a security breach and was never able to get an answer that made me feel confident my information had not been compromised. The whole thing was very shady and I’ve never seen a public statement from them on the incident and am no longer comfortable letting them have my money.

I have literally been trying for the last year to transfer my money out of my account and they don’t seem to play nice with other investment firms. I finally have the process to transfer money out started with Acorns, not just submitting paperwork to my new firm. The process is taking a ridiculously long time with numerous emails back and forth requesting confirmation DESPITE verbal confirmation to proceed on the phone. I have had numerous phone calls with the company over the last year and not once spoken with somebody who’s first language was English which made the entire process even more difficult because there was clearly a language barrier, to the point the advisor from my new firm was also struggling to communicate as we were on a 3-way call. (Note: I’m not slamming any specific nationality here as there were numerous accents involved and all of them were so heavy I had difficulties understanding. One person I spoke with even had roosters crowing loudly in the background!)

Additionally, the fine print says that when you sell your stocks to transfer out there’s a $50 fee. If that’s a $50/share fee then I will be losing a lot of money in this transfer. We’ll see how much I actually end up with once this never-ending process is complete.",1

Welcome 2022 and Acorns decision to automatically enroll folks whose bank information is still connected somehow to their platform (*because they don’t actually allow you to fully ever disconnect said information) to a monthly subscription fee “service” that gets you who knows what…   I haven’t had money on the Acorns platform in years. Bottom line: tremendously infuriating to have any systematic auto-enrollment initiative begin charging you money. There’s never any guarantee that we still have the App on our devices, we may not receive emails from a particular account that’s over 5 years old (eg an old school or work email)… we may not even be able to login to the App/Service platform anymore because of all of the aforementioned logistical issues. Don’t charge old customers money by auto-enrolling them because you need to drive your own revenue. It’s an incredibly dishonest and irresponsible manner of capturing a few extra dollars. Completely shameful. So infuriating that I’d absolutely be willing to be part of a class-action lawsuit should one ever materialize. Frankly, if I were a lawyer, I’d file it myself.",1

Another issue is on top of not providing digital cards, we don’t even have the ability to connect our bank to really absolutely any other party, or to another bank. Online banking is supposed to be made more convenient, not more tedious, or insoluble especially when contacting support. I’m not even sure if I’ll keep this bank account past this month, my debit was stolen, so I had no choice but to order a new card, however, due to not having my debit, and not being able to connect my bank to anything, I missed two on-time payments, and my credit dropped 111 points.

I have also been paying for what I thought was the lowest tier, that is $3/mo and gives you access to roundups, they’re save for later option, and they’re debit card. HOWEVER I recently found out the $3/mo tier that they advertise as the lowest tier in fact IS NOT the lowest tier you can subscribe to. I went to cancel my subscription because all I use are the roundups and not the other things they offer you, and once you click the “cancel my subscription” button they give you an option to pay $1/mo and only have the roundups. If you plan on putting pennies into this and only use the roundups, please do yourself a favor and go to cancel your subscription and downgrade to the $1/mo and save yourself more money than you’re probably going to earn from this app. The only way to make the $3/mo worth it is to have some serious cash in your account and get lucky. Odds are if you’re like me you’re not putting enough money into this app, and it’s not actually bringing in more money that what you will spend on it. This app is just a way for bid businesses to use your money to fund they’re own corporations and keep they’re stocks up.

I started using Acorns in 2018 as a naive student trying to get ahead in the investing game. After realizing this entire app is pointless when you open a brokerage that allows you to invest in index funds periodically, i withdrew all of my money and have not opened the app since early 2019. It is now late November of 2022, also 4 years later, and I noticed that they have started secretly charging me 1 dollar a month for a new subscription service ""assist"" that they started in June of 2022. This is very shady behavior, I have not used the app since 2019. I believe the company is desperate for funds considering the state of the stock market, and they are trying to sneak customer funds out from under their noses. I can only imagine how many others are being taken advantage of this like I have. While $1 a month is not a lot, it is the principle of charging a customer after they have not used your services in 4 years. This app is trash, get a brokerage and close this app to get out of this shady, sly companies grasp.

Thank you and I hope you take my advice,

Pierce",1

Additionally, they broke federal law by selling my personal information to third parties without my consent. This is a major breach of privacy and trust.
Furthermore, they charge a monthly fee of $3 for their service, which is not justified considering the lack of features and connectivity to other financial apps.
Their partners also have access to and rights to sell my information, which is concerning and further erodes any sense of privacy and security.
Furthermore, their customer support is non-existent. It is impossible to contact them for any issues or concerns.
To make matters worse, their service doesn't even connect to Plaid or any other financial apps, making it difficult to manage your finances in one place.
Finally, the high trading fee they charge eats up all your earnings, rendering the app essentially useless for anyone looking to grow their wealth.

I’m simple terms , they would take my money , lock my card and take forever to give it back now Matter how much you complain. You can’t contact internal team directly because apparently they do not have a number and only can use emails. They take forever and it shouldn’t especially when it comes to your money. Even using 24 hour chat support was a joke since they would just refer back to internal team.

I need to receive $500 referral bonus for referring 3 people.

One of my friends investment got cancelled and money got invested after offer expiration date.

But mistake is not from our side.

He has enough funds and nothing wrong from his side.He submitted bank statement to prove he has enough funds.

So we requested acorns to escalate this issue and give me $500 referral bonus

We talked with many of the agents.Its been 15 days no one is giving proper reason why i am not eligible for getting that $500 bonus.

They are just sending me formal email which has all the requirements to get bonus.

But they are not saying why my friends investment got cancelled and account not got verified in 14 days even though everything is perfect from my friend side.

Acorns is basically scam preying on people who are trying to be financially sound but don’t have the know-how or time to focus on stocks and such.
They have tons of options for getting credit cards and shopping through their app, and dozens of ways to connect your paycheck, cards, and bank account to make sure your money is flowing in.

When my bank assured them the funds were available Acorn said that they still had to “review the phone call” and is denying me access to my money for another 24-48 hours. Then their “customer service rep” had the nerve to say, “is there anything else I can help you with?” Needless to say, I will be closing my account as soon as they “review the phone call” and give me access to the account. Addendum: after another conversation with “Customer Service” I was told that I need to provide screen shots of my sending bank records showing the transfer and remaining balance in addition to a pic of my ID. Which I had to send to open the account. After I do that I was told that I might have access to my money in 48 hours. Then she dropped this little nugget, I might need to go through this every time I deposit funds into the account, which won’t ever happen again.
