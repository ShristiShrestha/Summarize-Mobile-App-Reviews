8b946bd1-c4ee-4e9f-93b6-4dcfeb35de3f,2022-09-08 17:46:22,Honestly this app is actually really soild the fact females have to text u first may seem annoying but thinking about it does make sense I mean if u believe in love at first sight then yeah and luckily I do and it’s not just the in app things I like I always read reviews on apps before downloading them and the fact the developers are actually responding is very and much appreciated all I ask is a lot of these apps turn into tinder after such a strong start what I mean is the developers stop caring at some point and eventually the app will have horndogs and bots as king and queen y’all are amazing just keep doing what feels right and also if another developer replies I hope u know ur currently contributing to something good atm just let it stay that way❤️,5
6a2f8ef2-e964-47b1-9383-507ea9190649,2023-06-18 22:26:57,"First, I’d like to start of saying this app goes against biology in  general, women do not like to take the first step to message a man with saying that the lack of swipes shows a lack of attention from women for almost all rates I’ve seen
Used for 1 year only had 0 meet ups, 1 meaningful conversation and about 10-ish swipes
And don’t get me started on the 24 hour setting that is implemented its garbage no one wants to download a app then have to rush to check it daily 
Lastly the amount of swipes you are given is barely a handful and when you can see that someone swiped on you but you don’t run across them kinda just ruins the experience 

P.S Most ppl laugh at bumble and devs should work on changes or watch app die and revenue dry up",1

Is there anyway Bumble could do a better job at sorting membership or you just let any phoney fake person join, so the rest of us are exposed to scammers…
It is dangerous joining this dating app.",4

9a08d95d-480a-40f0-a5e4-66f7e19bab3f,2021-11-23 12:04:39,"✨Don’t waste my time swiping right if you’re intention is to remain Quiet , 
It doesn’t have to be about “ making the first move “ - if you see a man you’re attracted to wether virtually or in real life , make him aware of your interest in him - simple as that 
______________________________________
This was my bio before what seems to be the entire body of women on the bumble platform reported my page for
 “ bad behavior “
 why’s that ? 
Because I understand that the nature of a woman isn’t to approach a man ?, I simply hold them accountable for their actions respectfully and get blocked with an existing subscription which I’m sure is a waste being that I won’t be refunded the money 

✨To all my kings reading this : 

- focus on yourself 
- delete all dating apps (especially bumble because like I said , it only conveniences the community of women who wanna feel some sense of empowerment being given the right to “ make the first move “ ) 
- approach women in person 
-go to the gym - work on your physical attributes 

and meditate 🧘🏾 

Not bashing this app 
but the creator herself knows 
exactly what I’m talking about 
In everything I’ve stated above 👆🏾 

Peace & Love",1

Two major problems I see are 

1) the use of meaningless hieroglyphic icons that seem to randomly switch around on every page makes navigation very tedious and difficult; WHEN will developers learn to use text menus that we can just look at to see what they’re for, instead of having to experiment by clicking on every one to see if they do something useful or are what we’re looking for?  A single drop down text menu in the upper left corner where menus belong would be a massive improvement in usability, instead of scattering meaningless hieroglyphs randomly around the screen. 

2) poor contrast of light yellow-orangey text on white backgrounds in Setup areas makes certain operations slow and difficult. Not as bad as the use of meaningless icons, but still unnecessary. Suspect the developer isn’t using naive testers on a variety of devices like he should, but instead is probably developing on a Mac with a high contrast screen where his light-on-light text is discernible and where the use of meaningless hieroglyphics for navigation has long been standard practice—and the reason that I and many others loathe Apple products.",1

The app's heavy emphasis on monetization, limited free features, technical issues, inadequate customer support, and intrusive advertising are areas where Bumble falls short in prioritizing its user base. As a consumer, it's crucial to consider these factors when deciding whether Bumble aligns with your expectations and preferences for a dating app. That being said look forward to the generic response of contacting customers supporting via Facebook, twitter 😩😩",2

Will be disputing the charges with my credit card if this is not fixed immediately . UPDATE Bumble support never got back to me after contacting them via multiple avenues so I had to contact my bank and cancel the charges.

A $30 monthly subscription obtains only the most basic features like unlimited swipes, 5 superswipes (which supposedly gain a greater level of attention from potential matches) and 1 spotlight per week. If you want any greater visibility it’s $60 or more per month which is absurd for a mobile dating app. 

Speed dating almost never works, and after “searching for matches” and “expanding search distance” comes back with a prompt to buy spotlights at $2 a pop, which actually bare zero relevance on the speed dating function - yet another sign of a money grab scheme preying on a man’s loneliness. 

Overall I have not had much success with this app, and while I readily accept my part in that, I have to say a lot of it comes down to an app which seems far more focused on gatekeeping and maximizing profits over quality of user experience, especially for male users. 0/10 would not recommend this experience to anyone I know.

On Hinge I get 1-2 likes per day without premium and as a guy I guess that’s a lot versus the standard 100 per minute a girl gets.

Bumble said: use “clear photos” but my accurate guess is they did something to make my account show up less or they make it so your seen a lot when you first start using the app and when you make purchases. 

Try 
Hinge 
Culture specific dating apps (if you have to please your parents)
Tinder
- Bumble is at the bottom

Making matters worse in my opinion, they clearly would rather charge you to fix mistakes than design a better UI. For example if you accidentally decline a match, it is possible using the paid tiers to “undo” that swipe (although it is not possible to undo a right swipe, even if you wanted to go back to actually see the profile). This sort of design leads me to believe that the ease of accidentally activating super swipes is likely intentional design, not an oversight.",2

However, the dual features of matches expiring after 24 hours and only women being able to respond first to curb harassment makes it rather difficult for people like me, the good-intentioned though usually overlooked users, to be easily ignored. I have actually seen less engaging matches on here compared to any other site, even Tinder, and those matches usually have me requiring to respond first to start anything. It’s a shame because the app is structured well and provides great features, but it fails to let anything flourish for someone that normally does not make first approaches out of fear of rejection but does so on these apps. It can make using the app feel worse than simply doing nothing, something I have experienced multiple times.

  I live on the Connecticut shoreline and my bee feed is over filled with people B’s from Long Island, (which is very time consuming and hence difficult to commute back and forth from) so I’m constantly swiping left. 
 Bumble users could benefit from a setting that lets the user Bee “select or remove certain regional areas” from their search settings. 
  Bumble also offer a subscription and a paid spotlight feature, which I get “likes from people B’s well beyond my selected (miles) area of interest- location”. 
 (If someone is looking to date 100 miles away and I’m only interested in a 25 mile area-we shouldn’t be seeing each other’s profiles) especially when being charged for this “boost”

Selecting locations and regions should be a feature, it’s more like a nightmare if you live on the Connecticut shoreline. 
 This technical oversight should be an easy fix and help people B’s find their match, not just where I’m from, but everywhere.

This app is making society worse in every way by acting like women can can exhibit no effort and spread toxic behaviors while expecting every man to be minimized for not being the epitome of society. No one at Bumble lives up to the selfishly proclaimed values of gender equally while they let one group devolve into driving another out of the app for profit. You literally have to spend money to be seen on the app and this is why the Bumble dating pool is a cesspool.,1

There needs to be some sort of hard timer that the end user can see that lets you know “Hey, you’ve got this much time before you can swipe right again”. But that would defeat the point of artificially restricting swipes-and it’s not because Bumble encourages “conscious” swiping. A restriction like this and lack of a visible way to tell when you can swipe again encourages engagement with the algorithm and pushes you to pay their insane monthly subscription cost. 

It’s honestly just gonna drive me to engage with Tinder more or just disengage from online dating apps entirely. Especially when, after you’ve paid that monthly subscription, they trip over themselves to offer you a half priced month the next month, since-again let’s be honest-you’re gonna sub and cancel to avoid getting charged twice. The “50% off” is the real price, but you gotta pay through the nose to get that offer.",3

And I’m not saying this as a bummed out nerd who is taking their lack of female attention out on the app itself; I use just about every other dating platform and get consistent likes/matches. It makes me think that users who don’t pay suffer when it comes to views, but I’m not willing to pay the INSANE amount of money they are asking to test that theory. 
They could easily offer a lower tier of premium with the use of ad revenue, rather than banking that users will pay the exorbitant amount of money required to get your profile out there - and that goes for all dating apps. 
This no doubt causes users to lose faith in the app, or the process in general, and it’s not a sustainable business model. 
It’s a bummer, too, I honestly like the idea of women starting the conversation and I’m sure it’s a welcome breath of fresh air for them, not constantly being bombarded by creepy dudes all day long.

Their policy is specifically for “marginalized” or “minoritized” communities which is liberal PC speech for people who aren’t straight white males. 

If ALL people are protected, the language wouldn’t specify marginalized/minoritized people, but instead say they don’t tolerate hate based attacks on race, sex, gender, religion, etc.

Bumble pride themselves on being “inclusive” and “welcoming” yet the language used in their guidelines give certain groups of people more privilege over others as akin to what you see in the media today regarding racial politics and there being different standards based on race, sex, and religion. 

It’s common for liberal/leftwing media companies to allow discriminatory attacks against straight white males. Their personal biases affect how they enforce their rules and some of you may have experienced this with other social media/dating apps where the majority of their workforce are liberals with these same prejudices.

Allowing women to preselect her matches, it increases the likelihood of compatibility. 

The bad thing is that bumble has the most restrictive character limit out of all of the apps in terms of letting you describe yourself, and the cost of the app means there’s a lot of dead profiles on the app who fled because of the cost so when you’re scrolling through potential matches a high percentage of the profiles you run across are probably no longer checking the app or logging on.",3

Is the goal of this app to encourage matching, or is it just like the match group apps now?

There used to be a way to go back to the person you just swiped left on once, but even that was a band-aid solution for a more serious annoyance that can cause some really uncomfortable situations having to explain the mistake or else quickly unmatch.

When seeking, I can no longer access any of the additional filters that used to be free, they are now only available for Premium and Boost accounts.

Additionally, when seeking WOMEN, there is NOTHING but heterosexual couples looking for women to have threesomes, and not actual single women looking for other single women.

Happened to get off all dating app platforms shortly afterwards until just recently, and trying to get my purchase restored to my new account has been a nightmare.

First off, I’m fairly certain Bumble is the sole app that lacks an in-app purchase restoration option, which feels pretty shady.  As far as I can tell, they also lack a customer service chat AND phone number, leaving e-mail as the only available method.  Initially, I was told they couldn’t find my purchase receipt.  Then, after explaining that I was not the primary account holder in my Family Plan and perhaps it was tied to that email — though it shouldn’t be, as it was made my from previous Bumble account tied to my Apple ID — they stated they had in fact already found it, but they would instead need the payment confirmation from my email.  Ended up providing it in a response, then tried following up and even sent a whole new inquiry, and still have yet to hear anything from them after several hours.

I have to ask, is this an intentional run-around to withhold services despite payment?  Perhaps even aiming at further purchases made out of exasperation?",2

I requested they review my data to prove I hadn't behaved inappropriately, and my pictures most definitely didn't violate any community guidelines.

So you end up never actually finding the people in your likes section so how are you supposed to match because likely others that you like will have the same issue. All in all I like the idea and think that if you are willing to spend money it will be great for you but is not for free users.,3

I like how the profiles go into more detail, allowing you to know more about users before making your choice, but my favorite thing about the app was the option to filter so that you only saw users with qualities and traits that you are looking for. Being able to filter for height allowed me to narrow the amount of people I saw down to a manageable number. Filtering for what users are looking for prevented me from wasting time swiping through people with different intentions than me. Required profile questions allowed me to learn more about users before I made a decision, which was a big reason that I found bumble the most appealing dating app. Without these features bumble is no better than any of the other apps out there and I might as well switch to other apps that don’t require women to speak first and let matches expire before a busy person has a chance to reach out if I’m going to have to swipe through every man in the entire city anyway.",2

Since I had only texted one anodyne response to one match among very few while briefly in Japan (whereas Hinge and other app connections have been much more frequent and high quality), I was perplexed and sent a message to the helpline.

Many days later, my spam folder received a response asking me to verify my email, which was odd. When I tried to use the link, it had expired, so I wrote another email to the developers, out of curiosity more than anything else.

They eventually replied that they investigated my case and deemed the elimination justified because I was conducting “commercial activity”. I can’t think of any of my answers to their prompts or anything in that one message I sent that would qualify “as commercial activity”. The lack of definition would be funny if it weren’t so unilateral and maddeningly unspecific. And yes, I had read their guidelines before!

I want to thank you for creating this amazing platform! This has been a life changing experience for me. Personally, Bumble hasn’t only served a dating app, but it was a huge support in my liberation process. 
I have grown up in a extremely misogynistic community where I inherited most of the behaviors, self-concept, and everything about “love” and “partnership.” Unsurprisingly, this was a miserable time of my life, and after I reflected, it was all connected to my lack self awareness, self love, and boundaries. Getting bumble has shown a whole world of opportunities. It taught me the magic of moving on, accepting rejection, setting boundaries and never negotiating with less than I deserve, and most importantly that there’s always someone else, always. 
This process has freed me from my fears, anxieties, and the misogyny that had controlled me for 3 decades. Thank you for being with me on this journey and helping me love life ❤️",5

I reached out to have my account fixed and they basically said not my problem. I explained it was a misunderstanding and that I had copy and pasted my bio into the wrong app which then immediately blocked me. Instead of actually hearing me and possibly putting me in a probationary period to review my activity, they permanently blocked me. I paid for the service because I hate swiping and they literally didn’t even read my emails based off the reply. Bumble overall was a decent app, but the customer service department is not even worth it especially if you run into a problem that is human error/ can be fixed and monitored for reassurances

Also many of the developers responses are copy and pasted repeatedly the same answers.

This is especially crucial when for example you move or enter a period of new growth. And BFF inherently recognizes that people sometimes are solely looking for friends where sex can never be an option and harassment is a nonstarter, hence it limits matches only to the same gender. That only works for heterosexual people, and there is no way to change that setting. Cis-identifying queer people have no way of seeking platonic friendships safe from the risk of harassment or sexual pressure. And the utilization of the binary completely removes choice and sense of belonging for trans and non-binary folx for whom harassment and sexual pressure are never off the table anyways.

In short, why is the platonic side of this app geared first and foremost with cis-hets in mind, with virtually no liberty for queer people? Do we not deserve friends of our own choosing? Are we inherently incapable of making lasting and deep friendships with others of different gender identities?? Bumble BFF answers the latter two questions with a resounding YES. Shameful.",2

Bumble is quick to revoke/block men from the app, but are more lenient towards women’s profile or wrong doings. I’m only going on 36 hours after receiving the automated email response from support, and the FB messenger support never responds and leaves you waiting in que!

Good luck if you’re crazy enough to use. I would highly encourage you to not pay for any additional options and stick with the free subscription, because they clearly state they do not give refunds no matter what.

However our social climate has completely changed people on bumble might not just be the “women” im looking for.

Personally it makes me think why not just have the timer count down for the “woman” to make the first move and after that you’re given a change to talk to them.

But over the past year, I have noticed them slowly going down the rabbit hole of valuing money over helping their users build meaningful connections.

They’re taken away the two free advanced filters for users who are not subscribed to Bumble premium, meaning if you’re looking for a relationship, certain values or anything else, you’ll have to swipe through a sea of people who do not meet your wants/needs.

Even when you pay, which I have, they continue to show your profile to men who in no way shape or form meet your filters, which is frustrating. Once my pay period is up, I will be deleting this app for good.",1

For example, Tinder at least has the feature where you can search numbers through your contact list and block them from seeing your profile in the app. I wish Bumble had a similar feature because you do see a lot of the same user profiles in most of the dating apps and I’d like to be able to block someone that I didn’t necessarily connect well with or from having a family member or coworker see my profile. Also the 24 hour match feature where the woman has to message the guy first and wait for him to respond during that time or else the match completely disappear is just not right. I sometimes go days without checking the app because I’m busy with work and life in general or choose to take mental breaks, before logging back on and then finding my “match” has disappeared. I’ve lost many potential matches this way or some that I’ve messaged and they don’t respond with the 24 hours. At least give the woman (who has to message the match” an option to extend that message time so that maybe when the guy logs back on, he has a chance to see the actual message.",3

It says you get a spotlight every week HOWEVER if you didn’t use the one from the previous week it doesn’t stack. So I was saving my spotlight and waited another week so I could use the 2 spotlights I’m entitled to but end up finding out it doesn’t stack so I essentially didn’t get to use the spotlight from the previous week. I feel cheated out of a spotlight that I could’ve used and if it gives you a spotlight every week it should say you need to use up your previous one because you’re not gonna be able to stack it with the one from the following week.,1

It went on for two days until they finally came out and told me they’re not actually the person in their profile, that they were just trolling me, and calling me gullible for believing them. I cussed them out in literally 6 words and reported them. It was so depressing and I felt like an idiot. Then get this… Bumble bans ME?! I reached out to customer support and they said they “investigated” it but they’re still going to permanently ban me because the company is “rooted in kindness, respect…” If they actually read through our entire conversation history and did their job right, they would know how royally they messed up and have it completely backwards.

I love the idea of girls messaging first but only ~1/20 of my matches say anything more than “Hey”.

This new feature completely defeats the whole business model of Bumble imo. I use almost every character in all three prompts in my profile so if that isn’t enough for a girl to start the conversation then maybe the idea of this app is slowly failing and I just need to go use a different dating app.",2

In the proper role of leader, just as asking to take a lady in a date or proposing marriage, initiating conversation should be on him. If she chooses not to respond that is certainly her option.

It is very frustrating that just because I look young they assume my age and tell me that I’m not older than 18. I contact the support team and they were like “oh yeah we blocked u because ur not over 18, and if u think it was a mistake you’ll have to send an ID” I TOLD THEM SEVERAL TIMES THAT IM WILLING TO SHOW MY ID CAUSE I AM FREAKING 21, they never apologized and treat me like I was a teenager when I’m obviously not.

When I do get a response back they last maybe a few messages then nothing like they think it’s alright to end it without saying anything. I wish it went both ways were the guy could message first because that would let the person know it could serious if he started the conversation.

If you’re into browsing an infinite deck of cards, this is the app for you. Bumble by design locks things behind a paywall such as an accidental swipe. Matching is treated like a game of numbers that result in many men never hearing back from women who they’ve matched with - but you can pay to match again. You are better off trying the real world, or a more premium dating app unless you look like a supermodel. Treating everyone like a commodity in an infinite swiping list isn’t a great way to look at and assess your next romantic partner.",1

For the last 3 years or more you’ve able to select up to two different “advanced filters” for no cost. However with the latest update now in order to get any “advanced filters” you either have to pay $20 every week or $40 every month. I understand Bumble like any other corporation wants to make a higher profit, but I think being able to get two “advanced filters” or even just one is reasonable.

User base:
In all the years I’ve had Bumble, I’ve gotten I think two matches, and one of them never even responded. For example: right now I supposedly have 26 likes (I don’t pay for the app), but despite all the right swiping I do, I haven’t had a match in so long I’ve lost track of time. Even when I had a paid subscription, only one of all my matches actually messaged me. I understand the gimmick is to let the girl message first, but in my experience most girls don’t message first so the whole point of the app is a drawback 

User interface:
Standard tinder ripoff, but the swipe function is so ludicrously sensitive that I often accidentally swipe just because of the way I’m holding the phone. 

User experience:
I get daily notifications from Bumble, usually multiple a day, and it gets very annoying. I like that prompts are an option but a significant number of profiles don’t answer any of them and are usually only a couple words.

Summary:
Inactive/unresponsive users, annoying amount of notifications, almost no matches despite almost daily notifications that I have a new like, all in all just a frustrating disappointment",1

All the times I’ve had success with Bumble was using the upgraded app to where I can just see who liked me. But I can really only justify the (outrageous) cost from that service when I’m in an area for a week or more.

It would also be nice to have it give you more profiles once you’ve gone through your 5-10 a day. If the only thing people are giving is their looks and they won’t put any effort in, I’m not compelled to like them, and even if I put down that I’m looking for nb or ladies I get a bunch of straight guys anyway. 

It also costs 22-40 bucks a month just to put filters on your search like not wanting to date smokers. I have asthma, it’s a health hazard to me and the fact that I can’t even mark that off really limits the number of people I’m getting that put anything in their profile, don’t smoke, in my age range and distance markers, that might even get a shot to view my profile.

Why are you promoting an even more shallow dating experience than you were before? Not that it means anything, but I’ll be deleting this app for good now and moving onto Hinge where people can connect with more than a heartless swipe.",1

Imagine being LGBTQ in an anti-LGBTQ (Republican) region and no longer being able to filter out people who literally say your lifestyle is an abomination! And imagine you cave and finally buy premium to hopefully meet another woman, and all of your likes are conservative, he/him men, when men shouldn’t have been able to see your profile in the first place!!!",1

Youre limited on how many swipes per day, no one who likes you back will send a message, and they only have 24 hrs so if they don’t message you it’s done there’s nothing else you can do without paying for premium. Overall this app is supposed to be about women making the first move but whenever they do it’s either “hey” or nothing at all so save whatever dignity and pride you have in yourself for another app that actually does better.",1

In Biz: Some matches are great people, but most won’t work for what I am looking for and it can get ambiguous as to why we connected in biz not in the Dating or Friends category. 

In Dating: Watch out for matches like the closet pot-smoking crazy that leads you on to a phone conversation and deletes or unmatches you to never be found again. These people are like kamikazes and really should be weeded out of dating platforms and alike for many reasons. It seems like a lot of people want to be saved but won’t care to kill you and themselves socially. 

Otherwise, Bumble has been the best app for me in  connecting in Biz and Dating for the limited time I have used it for.",3

I kind of understand the intention when it comes to the dating aspect of the app, but the friend side should not have a limit!? And 25 is an insanely low number. Even on BFF, I only matched with 3 people in that day because most women add their Instagram handle and never return to Bumble, so that wasted a swipe right.. Additionally, I’ve read many articles about how difficult it is for people to find matches with this new update because people will let the time run out due to women needing to send a message first and potentially being nervous to make the first move (been there) (or because of the same Instagram issue mentioned above). I don’t believe this limit will help anything but Bumble’s income. Let people swipe right on 500 people per day if it adds to their chances of finding the right person.",2

But if you want to swipe, you get like 5 free ones a day which is hilarious. If you run out you can BUY more swipes just like you can BUY opportunities to be seen by more people and how you can BUY more potent likes that people will actually notice.

If you use the app more and more each day and are a free user, the algorithm forces you to the back or middle of the selctions (agin you get like 5 free likes) making it hard for you to find outreach as well…unless you buy said outreach. 

You can use the app less prevalently and you will be rewarded about 15 likes to use for free to hook you back in (after not logging in for a week because the app is bad) to having more reign in your app but after that it’s just more ads or forcing you to buy likes.

Any dating app is better than this one but dating apps have fallen from what they once were, this is to drive profit from losers who are desperate for dates but are incompatible to most people, tricking them into thinking they are getting more opportunities. 

I highly encourage anyone to use anything else besides this app that targets the desperate and makes them pay for it literally.",1

The first week or so of having a bumble account is great, but my suspicion is the algorithm works to push you out of the dating pool in order to tempt you into buying boosts.

Like not even giving you the option of blocking transgender women, so even though it’s not possible for a man to be a woman and that’s the truth and what I believe, there’s no option of blocking that. So instead maybe 1/30 of the swipes is a man who basically just has long hair  claiming to be a female is in my feed, I don’t want to see that I’m not gay.",2

dec2fd67-2b9d-4ffc-b2b6-c040de0081aa,2023-09-27 18:28:42,"So I did a study for school where I downloaded six different dating apps, and compared them. Bumble in my opinion has a ton of promise but currently it’s not up to where it could be. It’s a fresh new idea with females having to take the initiative because most dating apps don’t really have that option as well as I get to both parties out of their comfort zone. The biggest issue I’ve had is it is definitely a pay to use app. If we compare, let’s say tinder you have at least 30-43 swipes before you run out of free swipes for the next 12 hours were as a Bumble you have 20-27 free swipes for the day. And if I were to compared to OK Cupid you could send comments or compliments wants to any person that you like or as bumble you only get two free compliments, or comments on someone’s page that you like your entire time as a member unless you get a subscription and get more. Just a lot of potential but it seems to have gone more towards pay to get any good features so unless you’re willing to invest at least $20 it’s not worth it.",2

It’s a much friendlier app than Tinder and there seem to be more people looking for serious relationships on Bumble. But if you live in certain rural areas, the distance feature can be a real issue. 

I live in a location that does not seem to have a high population of people on the app, or at least people I’m interested in. I happen to be about 3 hours away from two urban areas, one to the east and one to the west, were I presume I could find people I’m interested in and would be within a distance I could meet up with regularly. 

These areas aren’t within 100 miles of where I live, but the next option for distance beyond 99 miles is “the whole country.” But when I set it to the whole country, these two urban areas, the closest to me, get skipped over and I only see people who are from other states and much, much further away.

This is extremely frustrating and frankly an issue I’ve had with a few apps. But I know people are on this app in these cities because I’ve lived in them previously and used Bumble.",2

You used to be able to add two advanced filters (religion, politics, whether they smoke, etc) for free before having to pay for premium to use more. Now you can’t use any filters without paying for premium, which costs way more than it should. Greedy move on Bumble’s part, and a huge pain for me. Now I have to sort through a bunch of matches with whom I have nothing in common. This change comes after Bumble already removed the three free “backtracks” in case you accidentally swiped left on someone. 
In addition, Bumble has a clear political ideology they like to push on their users. While this isn’t shocking as most companies are jumping on the “woke” politics bandwagon now, it’s definitely a major annoyance when I’m just on the app to meet  people. Also rather ironic of Bumble to push a political agenda supposedly about generosity towards those with low-income and then remove a bunch of key free features.",2

The bad: my profile identifies me as a woman interested in women; but probably at least 1 in 10 profiles is a heterosexual couple **looking for a third!** which is really fetishy and uncomfortable. First of all, it seems bizarre that bumble isn’t regulating or tracking whether profiles belong to individuals or couples, and second, if they’re allowing couples to have profiles, then they should at least also give users the option to filter them out and only see individuals if they so choose.

The whole experience just feels icky to me because I’m looking for someone to date monogamously, and I don’t like thinking that these straight men are just reviewing my profile wondering if I’ll be the one to help him fulfill his gross fantasy of a threesome with a lesbian who **maybe he can turn!**",2

There are lost of useless notifications that make me think maybe I have a new match or new message but once face recognition unlocks my phone I’m filled with disappointment when it some promotion or astrology thing. Also the way it rations out the ability to like throughout the day is super irritating. Just give me a set amount of likes that refreshes at the same time each day so I know what to expect. 

The “women make the first move” aspect of the app is mostly a gimmick as beyond that it doesn’t really change the transitional gender roles in dating.",2

Even then, if you did pay for it, you can’t sort based on interests so you still have to sift through in an attempt to find anyone you feel you could have common interests with before you even match anyone. 

Used to be a decent app, now it’s just a garbage app preying on desperate people hoping to keep them swiping but not actually finding someone.",2
