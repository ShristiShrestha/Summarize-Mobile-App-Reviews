0327a2fb-32e8-4453-bacd-52c182a5d79d,2022-01-05 16:29:06,"I have been a subscriber to Headspace for quite a while now but am planning on finding a different app due to recent “politically correct” content that I find inappropriate and offensive. 

Martin Luther King Jr. famously hoped that his children “would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” In contrast, it would appear that Headspace has now jumped on the “woke” bandwagon that EMPHASIZES  skin color, offering a platform to those who favor “people of color” over “privileged” white people.

In particular, I’m referring to “Rachel” and her “Acknowledging Our Privilege” so-called meditation. Instead of focusing on gratitude, acceptance, kindness, and how much we humans have in common, this woman is negative and divisive, ruminating about those who have privilege and those who don’t. She apparently craves a utopia in which we all happily end up at her “finish line” simultaneously. Anything less is the fault of “privilege.” And, in the midst of this thinly veiled rant, she admiringly quotes a member of Black Lives Matter, a self-avowed Marxist organization that is anti-white and anti-Semitic.

My “privilege” has also included heartache and hardship, and only 80 years ago my people were tortured and murdered in the worst genocide in this planet’s history. Instead of stereotyping individuals as disadvantaged vs. privileged, Rachel might want to meditate about her own intolerance and racism. I will not be made to feel guilty or ashamed because I happen to be white, and I resent bringing identity politics into what is supposed to be a positive, helpful app, not a fixation on victimhood and unfairness.",3

And what are the first sessions, I decided to do a breathing exercise which I realize the instructor was having us focus on breathing from our chest. I’ve done almost the exact same breathing exercise in my abnormal psychology class but then main difference was headspace how do you focus on your chest and breathing through there instead of what we did in my abnormal psychology class which was breathing through your stomach and focusing on there.I have learned through my psychology class that breathing exercises can help people with anxiety by increasing the oxygen exchange which is known to reduce your blood pressure and slow your heart rate these two factors combined have been shown to also release tension that has been held in your abdomen. for example when you were panicking your abdomen tightens and constricts your ability to breathe which often times makes you panic more. Breathing exercises also work because the increase supply of oxygen to your brain stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system which helps promote a sense of calmness throughout you and you begin to calm down. Although some of their breathing techniques are different from what I have learned in my psychology classes this is still an app that is known for meditation and breathing exercises that can really help.",4

Headspace’s “Customer Experience” denied a refund I requested after my trial period ended and renewed, I used the app maybe twice during my trial period and I knew it was not the right one for me, fortunately my insurance offers an app at no extra cost to me, but going back to Headspace of course I would forget to cancel the trial period since now all apps force you to add payment before hand to trap you into these situations.

4d3f50f0-c24f-4607-b265-b72f88e99a9d,2023-07-10 16:17:01,"Upshot: IMO, headspace shines with (typically) well grounded and philosophically informed perspective that goes far for empowering those who take that perspective to heart, mind and ongoing self-reflection.

Rarely, do I take the time to review an app. I have too many more important things. However, headspace has been so fundamentally profound as not only a meditation tool, but also a source of surprisingly deep and nuanced philosophical perspective across a number of topics. And that’s really what sets it apart- not only do you get access to good guided meditations, but those meditations (many series’ are excellent companions towards better manifesting things such as compassion, appreciation, patience, etc) tend to come with some particularly enriching sentiment. 

Where typical guided meditations that offer perspective along with the meditation, that perspective upon deeper consideration tends to be shallow, ultimately taking shortcuts to arrive at some commentary which *sounds profound* yet really lacks true depth at meaningful application within one’s life.",5

95ba3297-4c1a-4ede-ab93-227e326df8c3,2022-01-30 01:22:43,"Overall, I really enjoyed using the app and have contemplated extending my free trial to a monthly subscription. I would rate the app a 4 out of 5. As a 2nd year grad student, that has a full-time job, runs a small business and is living through a pandemic, I found the Headspace app to be the perfect resource for learning how to manage time for relaxation, self-care and stress management. The Headspace app’s engaging content, user friendly interface, and personally customizable dashboard enabled a hassle free and positive experience. Regarding areas for improvement, I think monthly/annual subscription rates can be negotiated. $13 dollars a month not including in-app purchases is quite high in comparison to similar apps that cost around 3-5 dollars. I think Headspace can expand user accessibility by providing a much larger language selection, as well as incorporating content and instructors that demonstrate diversity, equity and inclusion specifically regarding ableism and age. In the book, Working with Adolescents : A Guide for Practitioners, Julie Anne Laser and Nicole Nicotera explain that teenagers on average spend at least 10 hours each day interacting via social media platforms and the internet. The authors recognize that although media usage among adolescents may present risks for youth, media also presents benefits and can foster community, accessibility to information that impacts youth knowledge and useful programs that teach adolescents how to deal with depression and chronic fatigue. Due to our current life circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic withthe exception of few educational institutions and workplace settings, life in this day and age has transitioned from in person activities to life online. The impact of burn out, stress, physical and mental health concerns on youth and adolescents has dramatically increased. Apps like Headspace offer youthaccessible ways to foster stress management, increase mental and physical health, practice self-care techniques and learn about mindful meditation strategies. As Laser and Nocoteradiscuss, messages received via media have effects on adolescent behavior. In this case, Headspace fosters the belief that individuals can and should create life-changing habits that promote individual and community mental health and wellbeing.",4

Inability to download sleep casts for times out of reception like traveling bc or flying.  I really like some of the sleep casts but will switch to another app that has these two critical functions when my subscription expires.  Like right now it’s 1am and I’m anxious and not sleeping bc I am trying to find something that can play on my external speaker and drown out noises.,1

I found your site & immediately joined your group. Although my journey began SO RECENTLY, I am surprised to see a gradual, positive change! 
As cynical as I have become about the archaic approaches of traditional Medicine “treating” patients like me, with greed being a primary goal &/or secondary gain, that is a major compliment to you. ⭐️The more physicians have to lose, the less likely they are to embrace the science which clearly demonstrates that mindfulness & meditation practices can relieve and eventually cure chronic pain.⭐️
I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on 7 back surgeries for fusions which failed, injections monthly for years,  opioids, chiropractic, acupuncture & countless “healers”, many of whom were charlatans. The tragedy is when the opioid hysteria began, meds ( my ONLY relief) were abruptly withdrawn, leaving patients like me with no skills to manage pain & NO quality of life.
However, I believe that this “Opioid Hysteria”may be the answer to many years of prayer.

It is nothing short of a MIRACLE that I saw those 2 lectures on YouTube during which a famous Pain Scientist & Physical Therapist made references to you. Having two masters degrees in the health profession, those two lectures really got my attention.
Headspace, along with educating myself on all the science which clearly demonstrates actual changes in the brains of patients who assume meditation practices, is giving me hope after almost 2 decades of suffering.
I can only express gratitude to you for the help and support I have received from you within a matter of days.",5

Furthermore, you can’t airplay the videos onto a different screen, so it’s impossible to consistently see the instructor while you workout and your form suffers from needing to juggle the phone or just do it from memory of the demo rep.

However; if you want to listen to anything on the computer while listening to one of these soundscapes you will find that there is no independent audio adjustment to dial the background sounds relative to other audio sources. (The volume adjustment is only achieved via apple's global adjustment and it means that Headspace will often play the background noise at non-background levels). I believe incorporating this feature would greatly improve this app's functunality for people who mainly use its productivity based content in noisy environments. Also, if there was a lightweight three band EQ as well that would allow users to really dial a nice seperation between foreground and background audio.

Each tab had different podcasts and meditation methods that corresponded to that subject. I enjoyed using this app because as a person who worries often, this tool allowed me to take time out of my day to clear my head and do something that betters my mental health. This app is relevant to abnormal psychology because it includes ways to manage anxiety and worry. Although it is not an app that diagnoses or properly treats symptoms of anxiety, it does relieve some worry by the various methods used in the app; it helps people who may want to feel better, but may not be ready to see a professional, don't have access to proper mental healthcare, or wants to try something quick that is available by simply pulling out their phone.

Looking back, this practice helped cultivate the most inner peace and stability I’ve ever felt. I’ve fallen on and off the bandwagon since, but this app has sincerely helped me get back on track in such an easy way. It is designed to help people who may feel uncomfortable with the idea of mediation, to help those who think they’re “doing it wrong” or for those who have trouble sitting still or in silence. I think a lot of people misunderstand the “point” of meditation; Headspace does well to illustrate that the point is to slow down an overactive mind so that we can observe, but not attach ourselves to, the deluge of thoughts in order to create inner space so that you can see the world around you more clearly and without judgment. Additionally, Headspace keeps track of the minutes you’ve spent meditating and the daily streak of checking in, which are just little things that help to make us feel good about the time we’ve spent and to make it a little easier to hold ourselves accountable for taking care of ourselves. Whether you are prone to depression or anxiety, have difficulties falling asleep, trouble managing your priorities or letting anger get the best of you, among many other issues people face on a daily basis, there is a mediation (often several!) that, with CONSISTENT practice, will help to minimize those difficulties in daily life.

The app is however expensive (if they don’t register with a nonprofit partner), and may not be stimulating enough to keep children coming back. Strategies such as yoga, meditation, and breathing techniques “are helpful for promoting well-being and resilience in youth” and Headspace allows teens to have access to skill building resources that they can take with them wherever they go (Laser & Nicotera, 2021). This access can be incredibly helpful for children who have experienced trauma, as they may not feel comfortable meditating within a large group. Headspace allows them the opportunity to do it on their own in whatever space they feel the most safe in. Meditation and mindfulness training are extremely effective interventions for those who have experienced trauma because they “enlist the whole person, and not just the mind”, as “trauma affects both the mind and body” (Laser & Nicotera, 2021). Headspace has exceeded in the way in which it allows ‘regular’ people to access training and skills about meditation that would have previously been harder to find. The issue however, has to do with the discipline and time commitment needed to truly benefit from the effects of regular practice. Many of the studies that Headspace mentions on its website state the benefits associated with mindfulness for youth. The issue is that in all of these studies, the meditation or mindfulness activities were led by researchers or other people who were able to hold the participants accountable, or remind them to participate. Headspace does offer the choice to be reminded once a day by the app, but it is easy to ignore. I believe that Headspace is very beneficial when used regularly. However, when used sporadically, the effects of mindfulness techniques are fleeting, and truly incorporating those skills into everyday life becomes less attainable. Overall, Headspace is a well-rounded app for adolescents, and may help them alleviate some of their stress or anxiety, in a calming and very accessible manner.",4

But that first month is very very difficult, you have to stick with it every day. Then after the first month or two, I found (back in 2017) that I came to enjoy meditation so much it was easy and I’d happily spend hours at it, had a 300+ day streak at one point, then foolishly thought “I’m good now right? I wonder what happens if I just stop.” You cannot. Do not do that, stopping back in 2017 is one of the things I regret most in my entire life.

Lately it seems like trying to get into it, I can’t catch a break. I keep seeing unfortunate news events, having close personal losses of friends and colleagues, getting upset, throwing my phone aside and letting negative (and incorrect) thoughts like “screw yoga and meditation, it’s like fighting a forest fire with a squirt gun!” And reaching for a much more… “unskillful” coping mechanism, like Wild Turkey 101.

Mindfulness meditation does work eventually though, I promise! And just now as I’m having a very real panic attack over some very real current events (war) that my friends & colleagues might not survive, I reached for the app and their SOS mini-meditations helped me out of that state of panic.

This has helped me deepen my understanding of the practice, while at the same time giving me a reason to come back day after day, year after year (this is my fourth year as a subscriber). Previously, I was just using the same recording over and over again, which got stale. With Headspace, the experience becomes familiar (in that you go through the same steps every day) while allowing me to develop curiosity by being exposed to the new concepts that help me refine the approach right away (a little like training wheels). Over the years it’s become routine enough that I can successfully meditate and lead others through meditation without the recordings.",5

Unfortunately, Headspace seems to have deviated from its core mission.

From breathing techniques all the way to positive affirmations, this app has everything you need to become less stressed and anxious. I have lived most of my life with anxiety and being an athlete has also led to increased levels of stress in my everyday life. I have always heard that meditation can possibly help with these symptoms I have faced with generalized anxiety, but up until recently I didnt know that there was actual science behind the forms of 'therapy' that these meditations and techniques teach me. This app has something called ""Wind downs"" which I still use almost every night because they help to calm my busy mind before falling asleep. One feature that is one of my favorites to use on this app is the ""daily meditation"". This section of the app has great positive ways to start your morning and has motivational speakers along with simple breathing exercises in order to prepare your mind for the day ahead. These techniques have been researched by the psychology field and it is proven that reshaping your ways of viewing yourself and attitudes can lead to positive results when living with generalized anxiety. 

Overall, I love this app and highly recommend it. I started with the free plan-which is still amazing and offers so many free resources to help you 'calm your mind', but I then got the subscription through the student plan and have noticed such a difference in the overall ways that I think about myself, and I truely think it has to do with increase mindfulness that this app has allowed me to tap into.",5

Moreover, their customer service is not only professional but also highly responsive, adding to the overall positive experience.

However, it is worth noting that when I recently decided to cancel my annual subscription, I discovered that they do not provide partial refunds. Even if you have several months remaining on your subscription (in my case, 8 months), they adhere strictly to their policy and do not offer any reimbursement for the unused portion. This policy is clearly outlined in their terms and conditions for auto renewal. I feel it is important to inform my fellow subscribers about this aspect so that they can make an informed decision.

In my personal journey, I eventually switched to another meditation app that better suited my preferences and needs. The content provided by the new app resonated more with my meditation goals, prompting me to explore alternatives. While I still acknowledge the positive aspects of this app, I believe it is essential for individuals to find an app that aligns closely with their interests.

They have a candid round table discussion where they discuss their own struggles in life and in their meditatuon practices. It’s also so important that they talk openly about the everyday stress in their lives.

Before trying Headspace, I was convinced meditation wasn’t for me. I’d try to sit and think nothing, but would end up fidgeting, restless, and just give up. The beginner series on Headspace held my hand through the learning curve with guided meditations, detailed tips & tricks in the form of fun animations, and calm reminders to let thoughts pass.

I love watching the Wake Up and trying out the daily meditation, and am especially stoked about the unexpected content like mindfulness and money, yoga & movement, and creativity.

I used the app a lot in 2018 then took my meditation practice further and no longer used the app. In 2021 I saw a subscription deal and recommended headspace to lots of friends and I also rejoined. The new app is just a confusing and an overwhelming mess of information and cross-branding. I opened it up today and see an advertisement for Arcade Fire’s playlist and dances moves form Lincoln Center? Sure that’s interesting but I don’t think it’s necessary for this app and this whole project to have such interference of information when actually trying to calm the mind. I’m sorry to say but the expansionist vision of headspace studios has lost the core of whatever is supposed to be happening here. There are tons of nuggets of goodness in here but you gotta dig and by that time you find what is useful, it’s just annoying and you’ve wasted time in your screen instead of meditating. Take yourself offline and away from your phone and find/create your own stillness. That doesn’t cost a monthly fee. I hope Headpace reads this - please tell your investors that the integrity of your project is at stake. Now it’s just another business in the wheels of the market.",1

Apparently I'm not the only user with this problem, and it really negatively impacts the experience. It’s been happening for over over a year so it is one of those things I guess they just gave up on fixing. The landing page and navigation is also really stressful for a meditation app. Instead of showing my favorites or recent listens, they put together a weird mix of like 6 random short videos and meditations, and then I have to dig for a needle in a haystack to find what I want. The tabs provided are simply not useful. The way they lay out courses leads to a stressful paradox of choice where you spend an inordinate amount of time digging and scrolling, which causes me additional anxiety when I am trying to prevent it.

I was questioning whether it was worth the money at first but after roughly a month of doing it I can say that it definitely is even though I’m on a tight budget because it helps me to be massively more productive and better understand how I feel.

I ended up purchasing the app because overtime I've noticed how it has enhanced my everyday living and honestly made life a little bit easier. The things that would stress me out no longer stressed me out as much because I was able to control my mind due to the breathing techniques. In my abnormal psychology class, we learned that anxiety appears in various conditions and looks different for everyone. Anxiety as an emotion can have three different components: physical response, cognitive symptoms and avoidance or escape. For me, I find myself most anxious at night worried about the future and the safety of myself and loved ones. So at night I would refer to the app the most and try what helped me the most… which would be the breathing techniques. In class we tried breathing techniques as well but the difference is being at home is much more relaxing than being in a class with 20+ students. We learned that breathing exercises increases oxygen, which slows down your heart rate and reduces your blood pressure. Not to mention that once an abundance of oxygen is exposed in your body, it will eventually reach your brain and nervous system. The anxiousness in one’s body is then replaces with a plethora of calmness. This app is really great for anyone who would like to reach a sense of mindfulness through a variety of breathing techniques, sleepcasts, meditation. The app offers way more than what I listed but those were the most helpful for me.",5

2) No contributors with DEGREES in CBT or Monks  

3) The sort of SF tech bubble vibe the current contributors have is for a modern term cringe.

4) The feature topics seem to be centered around race a lot.

I feel that for an app that preaches self help and the importance of mental health it should do better in not being a greedy corporation solely created for profiting it’s users.

They fixed many bugs I once had issues with. The sleep casts no longer have issues buffering. They also developed important modules for people who have experienced genuinely discouraging situations. 

The UI is amazing, and now that headspace is adding more tracks than we know what to do with it might be wise to have some way of jumping to our favourited tracks in one favourites sleep tab or day favourites tab. For example, water sounds always make me rush to the bathroom, so the sleep tab opening to the plentiful marina-type tracks might not be ideal for me. I know what I like but I end up listening to the same one over and over again because they’re too spread out for me to remember to listen to them.

Andy and Eve were the first ones I started listening to & then they got Kessonga and Dora who I felt even closer to (through culture, headspace and their added vulnerability to speak about their lives on a level I could relate with).

And, with time, I started to realize I was actually learning to let my thoughts go and be with my breath.  I could notice when the endless scrolling voice in my head was starting to wind up and bring myself back to the present.
