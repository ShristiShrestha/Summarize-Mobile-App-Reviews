2022-07-07 22:25:07,"I like investing on here. Yeah, savings are mainly through round-ups, but I’ve saved a lot. The spend account, however, neither makes sense nor connects to anything within Acorns. You would think you could just move money between your other accounts but it really is just a one way bank account. So I have no idea what the point is. Most people signed up using another bank. If you withdraw funds they go to that bank. You can’t even move invest funds to spend. It seems like they will send you plenty of notifications about your unused spend card but not explain that it is a separate bank account that cannot be linked to your other accounts in any seemingly useful way.

Edit: I did talk to customer service again and figured out what was making spend more difficult. It might be a decent primary checking account, but I won’t be using it for that. 
One thing I do like is that round-ups are easy. The other thing, which is easy to forget, is that Acorns will alert you when outside funds are low and pause investments, even when your primary bank doesn’t. Customer service is good, and aside from that time when everyone thought Acorns was hacked and started freaking out because the app kept closing, logging you out, or saying your login info was wrong, it’s been pretty solid. I lost a bunch of funds when Covid tanked the economy but I’ve mostly gained it all back. Probably from spending money to live, but that’s neither here nor there.",3,False,Alex Beckett,Great for Investing - Spend is garbage,

Take the Banking off of the featured products and this app will please you. Acorns IS NOT A BANK. You can do no banking here whatsoever, there is no documentation or literature to explain how this thing works. I have had this app for almost a month and I cannot perform any checking account actions. You need a bank account for this app to do anything. What??? So wait. You need a bank for your banking app? That is because you cannot fund it any other way because it uses your bank account to syphon funds from it. How much it takes from you account, when and how often is complicated to understand and you can easily accidentally transfer too much, overdraw your account and good luck reversing it as these things take forever. Check deposit? Not happening. Bill pay? Not happening. Loans or credit card options? Not happening. Instant transfers? Not happening. All you get is “feature not available” so you figure we’ll let me complete this milestone or maybe when the card comes it will work. Not happening. This app dangles carrots and nothing more.

2022-08-28 20:38:34,"A fraudulent company accessed my checking account and took almost $1500 from my account in a matter of a few hours. Upon seeing the first charge come out, I called customer support in a matter of a couple of minutes of it happening to implore them to freeze my debit card to stop the charges. I was told I would be sent an email, which I was, with directions. The directions were to log in to my account. Why can’t the person on the phone walk you through what do. I was obviously already logged into the app on my phone; how else did I know that fraud charges were hitting my account. I filed a dispute on the charges. I was told there would be a 10 day investigation with the possibility of a provisional credit depending on what they find. I will change this one-star review if this company actually does the right thing and provide me with the relief that I deserve and their insurance will cover. I hate to say this but I suspect it was an inside job and the same people who are investigating this matter are the ones who perpetrated it. I just received an email stating that I have not responded to their email inquiries (not true) and that they have determined that the matter is resolved on my end and that they have closed the ticket.

2022-11-11 21:39:28,"While they make it easy to save, they are clearly reckless with their customer’s Personal information. My husband and I both signed up to save passive income and it turned into a nightmare. We assume because we have a joint account. Assume because no one actually could tell us. His account was frozen first until he could prove his existence. After his was frozen, mine was next. I was asked to provide either a bank statement or canceled check in an email that instructed me to login to my account to do so. Well… since your account is locked, that is not possible. When you ‘chat’ you are solicited for multiple personal information documents such as ss card, DL copy, a bill and bank statement. When informed that the email states they only need a voided check, you are told no and to submit your personal documents via chat. I escalated to second level phone support and made the individual read the email to me after they were trying to justify this. They could not. I understand the potential that customers can defraud the company, but Acorns LLC has an obligation to protect their customer’s personal information and to be so reckless with it is appalling.

2021-07-09 17:48:03,"Make unlinking accounts ACTUALLY unlink accounts. I had “unlinked” my checking account only to find that, whenever I tried to deposit money or pay my subscription, the UNLINKED ACCOUNT was used. As a result, I incurred $175 debt from 5 (FIVE!!!) different overdraft fees, all from an UNLINKED account. Absolutely ridiculous — all the money I had saved in Acorns and more (about 2x more, if you’re curious) went straight to banking fees because of this ridiculously convoluted system of linking/unlinking accounts. I wanted to use Acorns to save money passively, but instead I ended up losing everything I had saved and more over the course of my ~2 month usage due to some silly fees resulting from either a terribly architected UI (make unlinking accounts ACTUALLY unlink accounts, don’t gray out an account that is still being drawn  from, don’t make me navigate past 4 different menus into some obscurely placed drop-down to ACTUALLY unlink an account, etc) or an egregious error on Acorns’ end. Such a shame — the concept for the app is wonderful, and I firmly believe it can help myself and others learn to save effectively, hence why I left an extra star up on my rating.

A dispute that I filed about a transaction I had seen that I had no knowledge of. So without calling me or emailing me to let me know the results of my dispute and after I specifically told an employee over the phone I cannot have my card cancelled they without warning did it anyways so now not only do I have to take the hit of the transaction unknown but now I have to endure the bombardment of returned payment fees if all the bills I have set up on autopay through the card that was cancelled. This is a very halfbaked unthought out protocol and I am on the fence of switching to a different investment institution because of this. And it’s not like they expedited the card delivery either, I now have to wait 2 weeks, and that’s business days don’t forget so weekends don’t count for the amount of time I’m waiting.

My brother then realized that they would take a percentage out of whatever you’re investing through them, so we both decided to cancel our subscriptions because they don’t tell you there’s a charge for investing through them. So we decided it wasn’t worth it to use them. Since you can invest through other places with no charge.

After changing information on all my other investment portfolios I went to this terribly done program to do the same. To switch my primary account I have to submit to them a voided check from the first bank and the new bank(which just added more time since I had to wait for new checks to arrive in the mail for the new bank). After doing that they said they would make two deposits into my new account which never came through. After contacting them they first told me i have to check my bank account and confirm the amount put in so clearly they didn’t care what my email said. They then proceeded to tell me I hadn’t properly cleared the switch and I needed to upload voided check images again… after the first upload i was told the one check came through improperly(which okay that can happen) and so I uploaded it again.

Apparently they signed me up for a subscription but I was unaware that this platform had subscriptions. I definitely haven’t been on this app in two or three months so why would I be charged a dollar out of nowhere at the end of March? The problem isn’t just that they charged me a dollar for what I consider no reason, the problem is why now? My other question is, where did this dollar go? And why would I pay a subscription to save money? I have a lot of questions needless to say but one thing that I am sure about is that I will never and I mean never recommend this app to anyone. It was a good idea when I heard about it but to see them do business like this, unacceptable.

Who wants multiple $5 (or thereabouts) withdrawals from their banks on the same day?  Second, the graph indicating profits/loss isn’t very clear.  Let’s face it, anyone who’s trying out Acorns knows of or probably also used Robinhood.  Their graph is a bit easier to understand.

However, in order to partake in this new option it forces you to withdrawal the investments you have already made, and then reinvests them. This causes taxes to be withheld from any gains you have made. I wish they would add an option to keep the investments you have while investing any new deposits into the new ESG portfolios so I don’t have to pay the tax on my earnings. 

Otherwise this is a great app and makes investing so easy. I have no other complaints and recommend this to anyone serious about wanting to invest but not sure where to start. Round up feature is great and the recurring investment option is pretty seamless. The amount I have accrued in dividends and the returns I’ve made on my investments have already exceeded the price ($1/month) the app charges so it has essentially paid for itself.

Another annoyance is the incessant email and app alerts prompting you to link your account with your work payroll’s direct deposit. No way that I can find to turn these off. 

The area that is bothersome is that money transfers into one’s checking account (to reload the debit card) takes a LONG time to clear… like 5 business days.

It said, “Refer 5 friends and earn $1000!” And then the Share Button (I have screen shots) So in good faith, I hit the share button, referred my friends who all started accounts, contributed, texted me back to make sure I got the credit, and guess what? I never received a dime. No credit for lil ole me. 

Why not you may ask? Because the actual link for me to get credit was on an entirely different page. The Share link right next to it was for something completely different, a gimmick in my opinion, and that, friends, is what I call SHADY. Why put a Share button right next to the incentive program and not have it count? I emailed, called, emailed some more but all to no avail.

Moreover, their referral program is a complete waste of time. I referred several friends, and none of them received the promised bonuses. When I contacted customer support about it, as expected, they were unhelpful and offered no resolution whatsoever.

2023-09-28 23:28:39,I ve been using acorn for over 3 years. It the best way to save or stash money. I already doubled my investment i also have it set to take money from my personal account every week. You so earn dividends which is reinvented and grows your account. The annoying thing is when you want to cash out a bit you have to wait a few days to receive it but it’s honestly not a big deal. You must!! add “acorn” when you do your taxes since you are gaining money from acorn. Thats also not a big deal the more you withdraw the more taxes you’ll pay do just let it rock for a bit!

It was not the first time I transferred money to or from this other bank. Acorns took the money and then froze my account. Wouldn’t tell me why. Required me to do a 3 way call with my bank to verify I actually owned the account. I spent more than an hour on the phone across two phone calls (not to mention several emails) to get this resolved. It was so ridiculous and such a waste of time. Needless to say as soon as my account unfreezes I’m going to get my money out of there.

I started using Acorns in 2018 as a naive student trying to get ahead in the investing game. After realizing this entire app is pointless when you open a brokerage that allows you to invest in index funds periodically, i withdrew all of my money and have not opened the app since early 2019. It is now late November of 2022, also 4 years later, and I noticed that they have started secretly charging me 1 dollar a month for a new subscription service ""assist"" that they started in June of 2022. This is very shady behavior, I have not used the app since 2019. I believe the company is desperate for funds considering the state of the stock market, and they are trying to sneak customer funds out from under their noses. I can only imagine how many others are being taken advantage of this like I have. While $1 a month is not a lot, it is the principle of charging a customer after they have not used your services in 4 years. This app is trash, get a brokerage and close this app to get out of this shady, sly companies grasp.

Unfortunately, acorns made a real big mistake and took the $5 weekly deposit, and then they took a double $7 roundup from my account, and on top of that made a mistake where I was charged the $3 monthly fee twice. As a result, I ended up with a -$5 balance in my bank account, and as a result was charged a $25 over draft fee.

If you have any real test for investing, it’s not built for that. You have very limited options on what you can invest in, the portfolios they choose may not be something you would want to invest in, and there’s no real transparency on that end.

It’s also pretty difficult to find where it calculates your true growth vs. the amount you have invested into it, which I don’t particularly love but as it’s a savings tool, I digress.

Overall, great app and something I will continue to use for the long foreseeable future.

I’ve chatted, emailed, and spoken with customer service representatives and they’re all terrible. A week ago I inquires about transferring my 401k to my Later Acorns account. In the chat, the representative had bo clue what I was talking about. She “escalated” my request and the other representatives sent me an email asking for the same information previously requested (security protocol , I understand). Provided the information they requested. Waited about 24 hours andfinally got an email. Unfortunately , the wrong documentation was provided. I reached out again via chat, wen through the whole process of identifying myself (although I logged in with my thumb print) to get the same response… it was a literal copy-and-paste from Acorns website how to transfer funds (I researched that before hand but my current 401k had different instructions how to transfer funds). The representative I chatted with went with the same sequence I previously dealt with… so I requested a supervisor. She kept telling me my request was being escalated. During this time, I’m on hold to speak with a representative. I waited 40 minutes. When I finally got someone on the phone I identified myself told him I am inquiring about transferring my 401k to my Later Acorns account. He seamed to be reading from a script so I politely asked for a supervisor. He kept insisting what I was calling for, so I responded I’m inquiring about my Later account and like to speak with a supervisor… he replies with “sir, I need ti know what you’re calling for” I responded with, it’s in regards to my Later account and I would like to speak with a supervisor… he hung up on me. I do like the concept Acorns offers,  but my patience is running thin. I’m currently waiting  for an email response (for the third time) for the same request (transferring my 401k to my Later account).

Stock market average annual return is 7-10% throughout its lifetime. If you only put in $5 a month and pay $1 a month then that’s already -20%. Of course you won’t profit like that.
I guess part of it is the fault of acorns for making investing in their app sound like a good idea for anyone who is willing to invest as little as $5. Sure that’s a start but the app is only worth it if you have decent money to start with or if you constantly add to it.
If you aren’t able to contribute $500 in a year I suggest saving up that amount in a bank account first before investing with a paid app. 
I used to have my gripes about acorns too, but the app easily shines when you do auto transfers and if you take advantage of the partnerships they have with companies that reinvest when you shop through the app. I’m able to make back the money I spend on fees by the cash back from companies that I was already going to buy from. In less than a year i’ve actually gotten like $50 from these deals. It used to be limited but now they partner with a lot of retailers (Adidas, Apple, Ebay, Levi’s, etc). So before I even purchase online I’ll just check if they’re on acorns and if they are then I buy from there for the extra money . It’s also great that the dividends get automatically reinvested. Automation is the best way to invest because you really just set it and forget it. But yeah a pretty looking and simple to use app that promotes investing to young people.

2023-01-04 15:57:44,"I give Acorns a 4/5. I appreciate that this app makes investing easy and accessible to unsophisticated investors and those who want to use spare change to grow their resources. I invest through a traditional brokerage, a Roth IRA, and also through a work-sponsored tax advantaged account. But Acorns is actually a fun app. I have two major concerns about the app: (1.) the “Found Money” feature is hard to navigate and unpredictable, and (2.) the “Invite Friends” feature does not always work. Found Money. I have redeemed just under $50 in Found Money bonuses. However, I definitely made three additional and relatively large purchases (hotel booking, flower delivery, and satellite radio subscription) through Acorns and never had any money invested in my account (the 120-day estimated time limit has long come and gone). For those new to this concept, Acorns has partners that offer either a flat fee bonus or a percentage bonus deposit of your purchase into your Acorns account. So a flower delivery or music subscription service may offer you $10 bonus for placing an order. Or perhaps your favorite travel booking website or clothing store may offer you a 4% deposit bonus back for a purchase. The problem is that you click on the icon for the store you want to shop with, and in a single sequence of selections, you have to make your purchase. Obviously this is not how the average consumer shops, and it’s customary to switch windows in your browser, respond to messages, or answer a call while you are making a purchase. Notwithstanding this, I can tell you the app has not always monitored my purchases and I have not gotten all of the Found Money I contemplated. Referral Fees. You can get a $5 for referring friends. Sometimes you can get a substantial bonus for referring enough friends (if your friends actually sign up) within a given period. I have gotten one $250 bonus for getting 4-5 folks to sign up in one month. One weekend I had company staying with me and invited them to join Acorns through the link. I watched my guest download my link through the text message I sent them, but neither of us got the $5 bonus after they linked Acorns to their bank account. Indeed this is a new app so some bugs are expected. In fairness, I have gotten the referral fee on 7 other occasions.

I know many bank customers lose or have their debit cards stolen throughout the year, so to not have the ability to access my funds when that happens is completely absurd, and the only suggestion is to transfer the money out, but what is the point of having to transfer to another account when you can just use the account you’re having to transfer to and have your deposits set up there. Another issue is on top of not providing digital cards, we don’t even have the ability to connect our bank to really absolutely any other party, or to another bank. Online banking is supposed to be made more convenient, not more tedious, or insoluble especially when contacting support. I’m not even sure if I’ll keep this bank account past this month, my debit was stolen, so I had no choice but to order a new card, however, due to not having my debit, and not being able to connect my bank to anything, I missed two on-time payments, and my credit dropped 111 points. Due to this I’m debating about a change in banks. I love Acorns, especially the ability to invest, and open an account for you child .. However, I feel completely let down when it comes to the importance of having the ability to access your funds at all times. That should be a priority, and it isn’t.

2021-12-15 04:27:40,"So let’s get one thing straight… you’re not getting rich or retiring early by rounding up your spare change, that part of acorns is a total gimmick; however if you’re someone who literally has no clue how to save money then I guess I can understand the roundups helping you change your mentality or shifting it towards saving rather than spending.  Although when acorns charges you $3 a month, a lot of that spare change will be going to towards your fees so it doesn’t make much sense to me in that regard.

Where acorns does start to make sense is when you have $15K or more invested.  At that point the $36/year fee becomes on-par or better than the competition (most charge 0.25% a year). Once you hit that threshold, then Acorns makes a lot of sense, because as your money grows, your expense ratio decrease; whereas with other brokers your fixed 0.25% fee stays the same regardless of how much you have.  So if you have a decent chunk of change and want to have automated investing with a clean, user-friendly interface, while not getting too overwhelmed with stock options and portfolio allocations, then acorns would be a very good option for you.

I hope in years to come they add a little more flexibility with their fees and account features because I think Acorns has a lot to offer, but they need to build upon it.  Enhance the user features slightly, offer tax loss harvesting, and maybe bring back the $1/mo. “Lite” model and you’ll have a lot more customer retention (IMO).  $3/mo. Is just too much for the target group of people you’re advertising to.  People rounding up their spare change will be paying insanely high fees where’s they could use M1 Finance or SoFi for free and have the same ability to save with roundups while having WAY more flexibility with their asset choices, etc.  So like the title says… “Great, depending on how you use it”.",4,False,Borrmu421,"Great, depending on how you use it.",

2022-05-25 14:53:15,"I love Acorns & I’ve been using it with contentment for a while now. I have some ideas/recommendations that seem reasonably simple to engineer and would result in lots of love from the Acorns community!! (By the way I only marked it 3 stars so the devs would see) 1. It would be great if the Widget for Acorns Spend updated every couple of seconds so that users can see how much they have without having to open the app and type in their password. I doubt it would be seen as a privacy violation considering that the only people that it would have an effect on would have previously chosen to have their balance on their Home Screen. 2. I think that if the Acorns GUI was customizable then people could be more conscious of their spending. For example, milestones appear before round ups, which seems counterintuitive considering that people care less about the future (milestones) than the present (roundups / what may be coming out of their bank account in the near future) 3. This one is less achievable and understandably difficult because of the banking infrastructures we have in the US, but it has bugged me a bit and I think it would be a significant improvement to the UX if Acorns users were able to deposit cash into ATMs instead of having to use their primary checking account outside of Acorns to fund their spend/invest/early accounts… this would give working class users who make a trade-based living and deal primarily with cash more access to investing. It would also provide older people with the ability to invest their money in a way that they are used to, considering that cash is used far more often by the elderly. This might be considered a stretch but it would also help auto-immune disabled users who aim to make the least amount of physical and potentially dangerous contact with others.

2021-05-22 02:13:01,"I’ve been using Acorns since the beginning. For the basic saving/super basic investing app, it’s good. Certainly plenty of room for improvement. I got the checking account with debit card right when they came out and have been using it as my primary account since then. Most of the time, I don’t have issues. Except for when I want to transfer money from my Invest account to my Spend account. NOT POSSIBLE! I know, a banking app that wants you to transfer money OUT to another account is required. Then, I can transfer money from my other, separate account with a Credit Union, back into my Spend account within Acorns. Meanwhile, at least 5 days has gone by, with my money in limbo. The performance of the Invest account, is mediocre, at best. You’re talking 3-4% gains on an aggressive portfolio. Meanwhile, Vanguard, a collection of stocks you can invest in by purchasing one of many Vanguard stocks, performs more than triple that on average. And Robinhood also offers a debit card now. So I’ll end up switching my primary account to Robinhood so I can invest and spend from the same account, with WAY better returns, and just as safe. And Not have to wait 5-10 days to access transferred money. The round-ups is cool, and adds up pretty quickly, surprisingly, without noticing I’m any lower on spending money. Another problem is trying to link this acorns account with any other app. Example, NerdWallet or any other budgeting app. Can’t link. None of my friends who use acorns can either. Also, I cannot transfer money directly from acorns to Robinhood or fidelity for real investing. I have to transfer to my credit Union first, then to Robinhood. Another 5-10 days of limbo. Anyone that knows stocks knows time of the essence on many trades. 5-10 days makes a difference. So with this lacking many features that they don’t seem to be addressing, because they seem to be focused more on creating a 401k for people, than to address the issues that would make this app/company more of a real value to me, and many others who may read this review. Just download Robinhood, buy any of the top Vanguard stock, and you’ll get a much better return on your investment. And they still offer a debit card with no fees. And your company probably already does a 401k that matches a certain percentage of money invested, so do that. It’s a lot better! Acorns is becoming good for a niche market, but not great. It used to be great for many people, for the few things it did. They do too much now, and not enough of what’s most important in accounts/money management. Unfortunately, I’ll be transitioning my accounts to Robinhood. These are NOT new issues. It’s been this way since the beginning. Just thought they’d fix the little things that make sense for a financial company like Acorns. They did not. It’s been years. Not weeks or a few months with basic issues. Years.

2021-02-21 16:34:49,"Acorns is obviously a great app for anyone who wants to be more resourceful. I like the app because it’s simple and the settings can be altered for your financial goals. Investing will get addictive and that obviously will be a pro or con if your uneducated. If your bank account is low on funds. Automatic deduction will cease until your bank account has suitable funds again which is a plus. I experienced few over-draft fees and Acorn emails informing me of such. 

Dislikes. Growth seems to extremely, extremely slow. It’s the long game but I’ve tested PayPal and invested Bitcoin and got a reasonable and faster ROI. Also more accessible options to acquire my funds. You really have to add money more often to see a difference. More funds goes towards the subscription fee in my opinion. Which makes the company a sizable profit for them. Example: I pay a $3 monthly subscription. Let’s say 1,000,000 customers have same subscription. That’s $3,000,000 a month, which is great for your company but I have no say in how my money is invested, which is inexcusable for me. Basically we as consumers are a funding source for them as a company and they reap the higher benefits, ROI. Transferring round-ups to Acorns take several days, same as selling your shares and waiting days for pending funds to your bank account. The idea is great but the execution needs to be way better and user friendly. Everyone has different income levels or spending habits, so that’s a factor also.

2021-01-11 15:37:59,"For me, acorns has been great and has never given me a problem, isn’t it backed by google??  I referred a friend and within 6 months of starting her account, she was locked out with $500 in it . When trying to recover passwords, it said there was no such account , no email found. WHATTTT!!?? Like we pretty much  live paycheck to paycheck and you’re telling me that $500 that she had been saving for months just disappeared and they let the  account get hacked that easy? This was 6 months ago. The account still has not been recovered and it’s hard to find a way to contact acorns that is secure . She isn’t sure of the exact amount that was in acorns since the roundups vary, but the acorns support put $500 back in her bank account and said that they closed her account out , and that she could make a new one. At the same time, recurring deposits are still coming out of her bank and cannot be shut off because we obviously cannot log in! While trying to make a new account, it says her email is still in use . It’s all just so frustrating and there isn’t the customer service that there should be with such a large investment app. 

Now like I said, I personally have loved acorns and it has put my money that I wouldn’t otherwise notice aside, the first year I invested $2000, this year I’m up to $7000. Now I only make about $50k and tips but i make so many small purchases every day that I don’t even notice that the money is gone , it’s like buying a coffee every day.

2022-04-16 20:51:56,"Acorns does have a sophisticated offering however there are two glaring issues that are of concern one the charting is completely misleading. It doesn’t matter how bad the market (or their algorithm) is, their charts always shows you an uptick, like it’s going great.  The reason they do this is to show the money that you’re personally putting in is increasing but it doesn’t actually show you the performance of the portfolio. Other competitor services such as Wealthfront show the $ value of your investment as the cash investment as well as another line to show how your portfolio is performing relative to the $ you deposited. Wealthfront is much more honest service in this regard.  

Secondly if you contact customer service )if you’re lucky to even be able to get reach them) on email they ask you to send back private information which is easily intercepted/hackable and can be used to impersonate you. Specifically they asked for your date of birth call Mary address on file with the email address and the phone number I don’t know of any other financial services or Fintech operations to ask for this over email. Good financial firms and security experts advise against sending this sensitive information over email. If Acorns would say to me here “we’re sorry you feel that way, please contact customer service” that’s complete waste of time I have advised them of this on numerous occasions and they have done sweet FA over a number of years. So I’m forced to write in a public forum.

2021-05-27 00:06:14,"The service is truly great for people who struggle to save.

Do yourself a favor and make a few one time investments. If you can afford it, set up a weekly deposit (you can do as little as $5 per week), and you should always turn on the round-ups. The round-ups are seemingly unnoticeable, and you can always transfer the money back out of Acorns if you need to. 

It’s worth it to make some one-time investments to get past your first hundred-dollars or so, because, to be completely honest, solely using the round-ups feature won’t earn you a “staggering” amount at first. This is because the $1 per month fee will be dragging your profits down, and the fee can be hard to outpace with just your spare change. Of course, that is dependant upon how much money you spend on an average day. 

That all being said, once you have some money in Acorns, the service works great. It is investment with no thinking, and it’s especially great for people like myself who struggle to set aside money. 

What is more is the incredible referral bonuses. If you are someone who can’t seem to afford regular deposits, Acorns frequently rewards you for referring new customers. There are promo’s which can earn you hundreds of dollars for referring a certain number of people (usually around 3-5), and you also get $5 for every individual you bring. It’s a great way to build up a chunky initial balance, which will grow faster and faster over time!

2022-07-07 19:45:07,"Hello everyone , I have recently had probably the worst customer service ever . For about 2 months I have had my account locked multiple times whenever I had transferred larger amounts of money. Talking to the acorns agents was a compete waste of time since all they do is give meaningless apologies and refer back to the customer service number. Recently I had my account locked yet again and when I asked to unlock it and to have my account closed/ liquidated. I would consistently have to “reprove” ownership of my bank and bank statements along with proof of pending amount no matter how many times I keep calling and talking to new agents (extremely frustrating). My but it would not post on my bank because they would close my acorns account. And Afterwards the money would be deducted from my personal bank account but I can’t use my acorns card since they locked it and I would constantly be told to “wait 2-3 days” and the internal team would take care of it and respond by email. I’m simple terms , they would take my money , lock my card and take forever to give it back now Matter how much you complain. You can’t contact internal team directly because apparently they do not have a number and only can use emails. They take forever and it shouldn’t especially when it comes to your money. Even using 24 hour chat support was a joke since they would just refer back to internal team. Point is I’m extremely disappointed in acorns and I was at one point very happy use the app and the card but honestly it’s not worth all the hassle.

2021-04-15 22:29:52,So I deposited a cashiers check. They locked my account when the check was available in my spend account.  I got an email asking for proof of why I received the check and what for. So I uploaded the receipt from the check that stated what it was for. Then I received another email saying I had to upload proof that I didn’t cash the check anywhere else. So I asked repeatedly what type of proof did they want because I was unsure of the type of proof since I uploaded a receipt the first time since that is what they asked for to unlock my account. They lied. They never responded with the type of proof they needed. They kept responding with the same thing asking for the proof. So I told them nevermind I will cash it somewhere else that I want in my account closed. Then I noticed they took the three dollars out of my checking account for my subscription after I said I want to the account closed. Directly after that they reversed the check for my spend account and unlock my account. Now they are saying if I want to cash the check anywhere else that they can’t close my accountUntil the check clears which makes no sense because the check is not from them it’s from a different bank so what doesMe cashing the check elsewhere have to do with them closing my account. It all sounds crooked to me. People going to invest with stash there’s so much better a way better bank than Acorny. So I still have an open account with him that I will never use just like I never use it in the first place the only reason I decided to cash the check there is because I work a lot of hours and it was easier just to deposit the check online then going to a brick and mortar. Will never make that mistake again.

Evidently they feel a $1000 dollar deposit is too much money to be handled electronically so they froze the account until I had a 3 way phone call with Acorn and my original bank to verify that the funds were available. When my bank assured them the funds were available Acorn said that they still had to “review the phone call” and is denying me access to my money for another 24-48 hours. Then their “customer service rep” had the nerve to say, “is there anything else I can help you with?” Needless to say, I will be closing my account as soon as they “review the phone call” and give me access to the account. Addendum: after another conversation with “Customer Service” I was told that I need to provide screen shots of my sending bank records showing the transfer and remaining balance in addition to a pic of my ID. Which I had to send to open the account. After I do that I was told that I might have access to my money in 48 hours. Then she dropped this little nugget, I might need to go through this every time I deposit funds into the account, which won’t ever happen again.

Update: Day 4 with no access to my money, though the developers recommended I call “Customer Support” just so they can tell me that they can’t unlock my account until it’s reviewed.

2022-07-06 13:09:52,"I joined Acorns almost 7 years ago and I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring all the different features to help me make my money grow. In my personal opinion, it is well worth the subscription fee since I’ve made that money back many times over after all these years. Although I opened with just a simple “Invest” account, I now also have a “Bank” account and a “Later” account. I am particularly fond of the “Earn” feature (used to be called “Found Money”) which pays me for buying items I would’ve bought anyway. Genius! It is just so fun to watch my money grow and learn about the stock market and investing at the same time! FYI: to this date, I’ve only deposited money into my accounts. Haven’t tried withdrawing yet so I can’t speak for that. 

My only (minor) issues have to do with the chart. In the past few months, the chart design was changed and I’m not very happy with it. The old chart columns included 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and “All”. The new chart lists 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 5 years, and “All”. My problem is that the new chart layout is so flat that it takes all the visual satisfaction out of using the chart in the first place. On the old chart you could really see the incline (or decline depending). But not this one. Furthermore, the touch screen to zoom into a particular day is incredibly finicky and hard to use. The screen is so flat that your finger ends up hiding the pop up info that you are looking for making it almost impossible to use. Please bring the old chart back! I just don’t like this one. 

I also have an issue with the “Total Gain/Loss” tab. That number should reflect my “Market Gain/Loss” amount for each column minus any subscription and advisory fees. But it doesn’t. For example, in my 1 year category, the difference shown on my chart is only $1.23. Since my subscription fee is $3 per month it SHOULD show a difference of $36 for the year. It’s not clear why it shows only $1.23. Where did that number even come from? And on my “Later” account, the number doesn’t differ at all making the feature useless for my Later account. It’s just confusing and when it comes to my money, I feel that clarity is essential. 

So please bring the old chart back and fix the issue with the “Total Gain/Loss”. I love Acorns anyway, but these small details will make me love you even more.",4,False,Philly Pilates,I Love Acorns BUT…,
2022-02-15 20:10:23,"Referred my friends so I can get a referral bonus. Long story short, they had shown the bonus coming into my account but then locked my account because I needed to upload identity verification documents. I had to send the documents 4 different times because I would talk to a new person each day and they told me I had to do a different thing to submit them each time. Most of the time they said that they had never received the documents! This was really frustrating because I sent pictures of my drivers license, social security card and even a bank account statement and if I was sending them to “acorns” and there was no record of them receiving them, who did I just send my identification documents to? Very frustrating as. A little sketchy. The customer service workers have no idea what they are doing. I finally got my account unlocked and then the bonus they claimed was coming, was no longer coming. I contacted them wondering why I was getting the bonus then all of a sudden why they just got rid of it… I contacted them and they claimed that the people I referred did not complete the necessary requirements for me to get the bonus even though it was already on its way. They then said that I couldn’t receive the bonus even if the people I referred completed their “necessary” requirements because the promotion time period had already passed. Very convenient for them to say that after the referral period had passed but not tell me that my friends referrals weren’t going to work until it’s too late. Such a big scam and a little sketchy.

2022-09-19 15:06:57,"The Acorns model seems really great. I’ve had an account for several years now and had decent dividends. Last year they had some sort of major glitch in which most accounts (if not all) were sent an email saying their account was locked, followed by an unprofessional email stating that their account was not locked. I contacted Acorns immediately to find out if there had been a security breach and was never able to get an answer that made me feel confident my information had not been compromised. The whole thing was very shady and I’ve never seen a public statement from them on the incident and am no longer comfortable letting them have my money.

I have literally been trying for the last year to transfer my money out of my account and they don’t seem to play nice with other investment firms. I finally have the process to transfer money out started with Acorns, not just submitting paperwork to my new firm. The process is taking a ridiculously long time with numerous emails back and forth requesting confirmation DESPITE verbal confirmation to proceed on the phone. I have had numerous phone calls with the company over the last year and not once spoken with somebody who’s first language was English which made the entire process even more difficult because there was clearly a language barrier, to the point the advisor from my new firm was also struggling to communicate as we were on a 3-way call. (Note: I’m not slamming any specific nationality here as there were numerous accents involved and all of them were so heavy I had difficulties understanding. One person I spoke with even had roosters crowing loudly in the background!)

Additionally, the fine print says that when you sell your stocks to transfer out there’s a $50 fee. If that’s a $50/share fee then I will be losing a lot of money in this transfer. We’ll see how much I actually end up with once this never-ending process is complete.",1,False,LEI81,To good to be true?,

Not really… You may follow the status of your referrals through the app and my last one’s status stayed “in progress“ for a long time.

His status did not change though. I called Acorns and they assured me that if he had completed the initial transfer there shouldn’t be any problem. I waited for another week, called again but was told a that someone will reach out by email. They listed a bunch of requirements and told me that my friend might have not satisfied one of them. I checked all of them and they were all satisfied! I asked them to be more specific but of course they couldn’t. I sent screenshots from my friends account proving that he did satisfy all the requirements but they didn’t care. Instead, they blocked my friends account right after I reached out to them with the proof and asked more documents to verify his account. Same thing happened to one my referrals when he referred other people. Somehow they started asking more and more documents for his last referral to make sure the final referral is not complete before their deadline.

2022-05-21 16:32:40,"Acorns is an almost flawless investing app, and I would have given it 5 stars if not for a few minor (but rather inconvenient) issues.
First the good:
If you’re bad at saving money like me, this is the app for you. I have an above average knowledge of stocks and Acorns strategy of investing in diversified indexes is great. The fact that they repeatedly emphasize a buy and hold strategy is great too, and a LOT of my age group in their 20’s and 30’s need to hear this. Time in the market >> timing the market, and Acorns takes advantage of this strategy to a T. While the lack of customization for holdings may be a put off to some, most successful investors have portfolios very similar to Acorns. 

Their checking account is a must have for round ups which are so crucial in passive investing. And their debit card feels nice in your hand and is great to use. I only wish it had a touch to pay feature which is very common on new cards

And their customer service is beyond amazing. Prompt with replies and extremely helpful, they really help set this app apart from others.

Now for the bad:
If there’s any area in which Acorns will lose out to other apps, it’s the lack of a high yield savings account and saving strategies to keep a more liquid portion of your cash saved for more short term expenses. Take betterment for example, and their savings goals, which allows you to save money for a rainy day AND invest. Apps like So-Fi and Digit have similar strategies. I need to have a separate checking account with savings goals in order to maintain rainy day savings that are kept separate from my spending account, since acorns doesn’t offer this. 
Im a firm believer that not every dollar you save should be invested, and instead investors need to have a certain amount of money (6-8 months of living expenses) in liquid to tide over rough spells. If this current bear market thought us anything, it’s the fact that everyone needs a safety buffer. Im surprised Acorns missed this important point. Maybe they overlooked a savings account or maybe they just didn’t feel the need to offer one.
I just do hope they read this and consider adding one so I can make do with one place to store my money and not have to transfer funds separately into Acorns to spend 

Otherwise this is a brilliant app. Keep up the good work.",4,False,Irvinpinto,An (almost) flawless investing app,"{'id': 29894802, 'body': 'We appreciate your feedback and well-thought review!

They then prompted me to make a checking account, so I did. After it sent me emails confirming the card will be on the way once I put a certain amount in the checking account, the checking account was closed for no apparent reason. I stopped the two other savings account from automatically pulling out however it still pulled money out 2 days later, even though it took them 4-5 days to take out the first one. Then not even a day later, my entire account was locked. In order to unlock they are requesting my bank statements with my name and routing number attached. I attempted to contact them via chat and phone, and agents will assure you they will escalate, but then they don’t. I requested a refund and to close my account, the agents then claimed they couldn’t find my account, then stated they can’t refund or close unless I submit personal information such as bank statements with my name on it and account number to them. When trying to escalate to a manager or supervisor, they say they can’t transfer (I’ve tried chat and phone). After all that, I just had to go to my bank to block charges from this company, after reading reviews it’s evident this company does this where they lock your account to acquire more personal information, and does not unlock it at all all while requesting more information from you.

What caught my attention was an offer for $1,000 to sign up 5 of my friends.  Wow a free $1,000 for virtually no work!?  Has to be some kind of catch....  Well I signed up and got 5 friends to do it and of course it turned out to be a scam.  Let me start by saying that people do not want to be bothered with something like this.  I thought it would be easy to get friends to sign up.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  My longtime friends and even family members were very annoyed that I asked them to do this.  Several friendships with friends and family members actually ended up being severed simply by me asking them to sign up for this app.  Well, despite this I was able to get 5.  I had read the fine print for this deal very well as I know companies like this are often notorious for hiding some catch in the small print.  So the promotion ends and my low and behold I DON’T get it!??  So I call customer service.  After explaining the situation to the rep (one of these guys clearly from INDIA who has a thick accent and doesn't speak English well and is obviously reading from a script) he says there's nothing he can do.  I ask to speak to a supervisor.  He says one will call me back.  So we wait all day and nobody calls us back.  The next day I call back and the same thing - we are told someone will call us back.  This happens literally 4 times!  Nobody ever calls me back.  I write emails to the company.  I reach out on social media.  NOTHING!  Despite having definitely at the required 5 people, I DON’T GET THE PROMOTION!!!!!  See the attached photo for yourself.  So now I am absolutely enraged!  I want what is owed to me for all the hard work I did!  Not only did I get at least 5 people to sign up, but many of them got people to sign up as well.

I’m almost positive this is a fake, they have tried to get funds from my account 3 times not realizing I have proof of all and not even asking to see it. They initially took the $5 I invested and a bit later I figured I would invest more, well once I did that I get a email from my bank saying they were sorry but my account was closed and they didn’t want to do business together anymore! I had not done anything for this to happen so I then go into my acorns account bc it said my bank had issues so I just canceled that bank out NEVER placing my other as the main one for investments. The next day I go onto my bank account and guess who took $5 out without asking? That’s right acorns, go into my account and it’s there so I email them bc in extremely angry and within that day the $5 disappeared from my account yet was not placed back in my bank account.. I have emailed repeatedly over this and a few other issues (then depositing money to “verify” my bank yet tell me those deposits they put are wrong) again had proof they were in the wrong. Just yesterday they yet again tried to get another $5 from me but I was a step ahead, I emptied my spending account out and hid my money in another account they do not have. I emailed them asking for the 4th time for my $5 back and they tell me they couldn’t take it bc I didn’t have the funds.... Uhhh no I’m talking about the $5 before that time that I have PROOF of (not the initial $5 to start the account either) but they don’t want to hear it, don’t want to help and continue to do things their way.

2021-01-21 02:23:53,"I’m in my early 20s, almost mid 20s. I’ve had Acorns for almost 2 1/2 years, so I feel that I can state with enough certainty how the app is. 

I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to build a savings account and to have a sense of security for long-term growth. I started the same as most people with $5 in September of 2018. As of January 20, 2020, I now have $2,246 (a total of 29% ROI). 

I average about $65-75 a month in automatic deposits since I use the 2x option for the last year 1/2. 

Listen, is it the highest ROI? No. And it won’t be and I expect this. However, when you think of the idea of this coming from PENNIES, then you realize how powerful of a savings account/emergency account this could be. This is money I would have never saved myself and just happens to be there because of the round-up idea. (To the highest dollar). 

But when you combine this account with other investments like Roth IRA/ 401k/ generic investing in Schwab/Robinhood/ etc, how can you possibly go wrong?! It’s an automatic investment tool that grows you a nice cushion! 

I also really enjoy the plethora of business that you can collect cash back from. Sure, it’s not automatic and it’s not the quickest, but it will happen. And since 2018, the number of companies partnering with Acorns has grown 10-fold. 

So if you are someone who wants to add an investment account, save for an emergency nest egg, wants to see long term growth potential, or just wants an investment account that’s completely hands-off, I highly recommend Acorns and continue too for people who ask. The pros (in my honest opinion) greatly outweigh the cons.",4,False,Loveofalmostallmusic,Think of it as a Savings Account (because it is),

2022-11-12 16:27:43,"I don’t recommend this app to anyone. This company doesn’t honor their clients and customer service never responded to questions, especially the harvest team.

About two months I saw that acorns was advertising a bank fee reimbursement program. After I signed up and followed through with the steps for the reimbursement I received an email with a header called “reimbursement receipt” although there was no number disclosed in the email. In the email I was told the harvest team would follow up in the next 2-3 business days after they calculated their own fees for the program. Well, since then I have never gotten an actual amount for the reimbursement nor was I told which account my money would be reimbursed to. As I stated before this is going back to the middle of September. 

Since then I have been tried numerous times to get a hold of the harvest department, and all I’ve been told by customer service is a representative from the harvest team will be reaching out. By the way, there’s no number for the harvest team. There is an email but no one responds, there is a web page, but no one responds, and there’s a chat line, but no responds. The only representative you can get a hold of is the general customer service agent. When I asked to escalate this issue and talk to a manager or supervisor I’m told I can not, only they can. It’s a huge problem! 

It’s almost as if acorns set up a harvest refund program with no one in charge of it. When I ask to speak to a representative from that team I’m constantly told someone will be reaching out, but no one never actually does. I have been a loyal customer with Acorns since 2016 and all I’m looking for is transparency and I can’t even get that. I will be pulling my money out today.

-first of all it is almost impossible to cancel your membership
-second they have these fake referral programs when support finds every excuse to not count your referrals so you waste time and energy referring people just for them to tell you it’s not valid. (happened 6 times)
-third the customer support should be called “Blame the customer department” when you tell them there is a problem in a certain part of the app they just keep telling you it’s your fault. When you ask them why your referrals aren’t going through they say things like “we don’t know from our end but you did something wrong” gaslighting people into thinking it’s their fault
-Finally fourth I have reason to believe this is an outright scam. Portfolios don’t go up with the market for some reason. They always stay very still (at high risk investment option) I feel like they take away your earnings when your portfolios do good and take away from them when they perform poorly. 

Overall good concept but terrible execution. If you’re on the fence about downloading, don’t. They are a bunch of rich stuck ups taking money from small businesses and not so better off people for their own gains. 
If you see this acorns, I spent so much time referring 6 people when the deal said I only need to do 3 referrals but your gaslighting department kept telling me only one is valid when I witnessed them make deposits and fit all criteria. Make this right.",1,False,khalilabbasov,Sneaky scammers,
2021-07-21 22:17:28,"My account was locked due to an error on the part of Acorns and I was unable to access any of my funds (over $1000) for an entire month. 

I exchanged 20+ e-mails and spent hours on the phone with multiple “advocates” in an attempt to get in contact with someone who could recover my account. No one seemed to understand why my account had been locked nor knew how to fix it.

The phone “advocates” repeatedly told me that they could not recover my account themselves - only “supervisors” and the “internal team” would be able to access the application’s backend. But each time I called - nearly every day of the week & at nearly every time of the day - there were no supervisors available to assist me. I was told time and time again that my case had been escalated to “urgent” and that I would receive and email or call back from a supervisor or member of the internal team within 1 business day. I never received any communication.

The only way I finally got in contact with a supervisor was by forcing an advocate to stay on the line with me for over an hour so that she could connect me immediately with her direct supervisor after he finished a meeting that she saw in his calendar. After a full month of consistent communication, this was the only way I could get in touch with anyone who could recover my funds. It took this supervisor 3 hours of communication with his “internal” team to recover my account. I was given no explanation as to why my account was locked.

What should be a simple referral process did not correctly capture four very close friends’ referred accounts and although I attempted to be patient and assume the best, I grew frustrated with the continued follow-up required only to be emailed what seems to be a template advising no one could help and that I should reach out again if I had additional questions. I gave Acorns the benefit of the doubt the first and second time this happened, but it became quite clear by the fourth time there was a referral issue that there is no incentive for Acorns customer support to fix the “broken referral link” issue - especially once your friend or family’s account is opened. 

I called and emailed much more than I would have liked to and was surprised at how unpleasant the referral bonus process has become but ultimately leaving this review for the benefit of other users who go through the efforts of referring friends and family. I did speak to a supervisor to advise that it feels the referral bonus program is set up for us to fail somewhere along the way. I successfully completed referral bonuses in the past, but the previous two referral bonus periods have changed for the worse compared to the originally simple process.

2021-02-19 16:17:57,"So, at first I thought the company was just cute. It’s a nice way to take my change and invest it. Then the terrible customer service really tugged at my last nerve. 

Attempted 5 or 6 times to submit my proof of address, and kept getting “document had a different name than the one provided”. Obviously this is a robot “verifying” my identity. That is what led me here, but that’s not the point I want to make. 

Whether you’re paying $1,$3, or $5 monthly in 10 years you’d have paid $120, $360, or $600 for their “service”. This is actually the worst investment plan available in this niche. 

For example, Ally Bank will do this same thing, Chime Bank will do this same thing. Round up and invest the difference. For FREE. I may be wrong and it may be savings account, but you can look to better investment opportunities as well:

Betterment and M1 Finance do this same robo-advised investments based on the answers to the short questionnaire experienced with Acorns. Betterment is almost the exact same, whereas M1 will allow you to be more in control of “where” your investments can go. 

Remember, you’re expecting to see returns of 12,36,60 per year JUST to break even. Do you spend that much change? You’re putting your finances into their (robots?) hands. 

Acorns - if you truly cared about our security, you would be more cognizant of your customers issues with your non-human securities. I’m 100% not anti-roboadviser. I’m anti “set it and forget it” whilst being unresponsive.",1,False,FlappyJalappynose,Do The Math,

Also- document EVERYTHING, and create a file for said documentations- because they will make you provide step by step proof of the requests you made WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM. The whole thing is an unethical, dishonest funneling fiasco. But hey, you might make a couple hundred dollars in a year.

2022-07-22 18:20:48,"I’ve been using acorns for about a year and a half and I have liked the concept of roundups. It’s a nice passive way to save money. That’s where I give my stars.

However, I have recently lost trust in the company. They have a referral program that has high payouts that I decided to go for. 5 referrals in a week you’d get $1200, 2 referrals the next week you get $500. And each referral you get $5. So I’ll admit I paid people to sign up with my referral code and got all of them signed up far in advance before the deadline. They did all the requirements, deposited money and everything. 

It’s been 2 months now and I have not received anything from acorns. The referrals say “in progress” so I contacted customer service over chat and they’d refuse to answer the problem and just said, “sorry it didn’t work and doesn’t count” which I think is strange considering I had 7 people sign up you would think even one of them would count for the $5 right? Nope. I get other accounts privacy being important but they already knew what was happening. Then the customer service rep quickly ended the chat out of nowhere.

A few days later I decided to call Acorns. The lady was helpful but told me the reason was because they didn’t “verify their accounts” which makes no sense as they had to already deposit money and they all showed up as “in progress” on the referral status updates. If they weren’t verified they wouldn’t show up at all and shouldn’t have been able to move forward with acorns. And the terms and conditions they have say NOTHING about that. However they just said there’s nothing they can do and just said I should try for the next $5 bonuses (the bonuses go down significantly after you do one or two). I don’t think so. I’m going to need some real compensation to make this one alright not just a “too bad so sad” or a pity response from the developer on this review with no actual help/results. While speaking with support the whole thing felt pretty fishy if you ask me.

While I originally loved the concept I can’t recommend it anymore because I don’t trust this company to live up to any of its promises. I’ve seen other people have the same problem. I will more than likely be moving my money out of my account and I suggest if you’re debating whether or not you should as well take some time to look into the company and how well they keep their promises.

2021-12-16 17:14:55,"Update: Some days passed after making this review, and I got an email saying they would like to try to help me again. So I went to customer support and submitted a ticket explaining my problem. A few days after that it got approved. I got my refund so I will change my 1 star to 3 stars, but no more than that because I feel the process was unnecessarily long.

 (Old review:) A few months ago, I had made an Acorns account. I didn’t fully finish the setup process. After a while I had forgot about the app. But today, I realized they charged me $5 this month. Which is weird because they never charged me the previous months. So why now all of a sudden? My bank account wasn’t even verified! Well, I go to customer support and explain my situation to Karishma Gupta. To sum it up, I told her that I’m struggling financially at the moment and cannot afford this subscription so I would like to get a refund. She dismisses me and just says she can close the account to avoid any further charges. I kindly ask again why I cannot get a refund for this as it’s odd for them to randomly charge me this month and not the others. She tells me to provide a screenshot of the money being removed. After I send it, she says the transaction wasn’t able to go through as my bank account isn’t verified. Yet I showed proof that it did? How was it “not able to go through” but my bank account says the transaction has already been processed? It doesn’t make any sense to me. I feel that this app has potential. But if you cannot make sure that your customers are satisfied, that’s a problem. Me requesting a refund wasn’t even that big of an issue, that should have been an easy fix. You guys are just finessing people. Not that it matters to you but I don’t think I will return to this app even when I can afford it. The customer service is just not worth it.

It is nice to have an app that will do the math for rounding up the difference of what you spend and transfer it to a savings account.  It doesn’t cost much since it is only $1 per month subscription fee. (UPDATE: service is now $3 a month.)

Until the recent update, it was nice being able to look at all of my transactions made on all my credit cards that were linked up with Acorns.  Heck, 2 years ago I was able to spot a fraudulent charge on one of my accounts and get that resolved before it became a bigger issue. Acorns customer service was really good at helping me figure out the details of that fraudulent transaction, I even received calls from them and spoke to a customer service rep.  

However, the last couple times I have emailed them regarding and issue, I have not received a response.  They recently updated the app and now I am only able to see the last 2 most recent transactions.  Unless I “round-up” those transactions, I cannot see any others.  Well, once I have 2 transactions that require a full $1 “round-up” I cannot see any other transactions and I am not going to “round-up” full dollar transactions.  

Since I have sent out an email asking how to see all of my transactions (about 4 days ago), I have not heard anything from Acorns except from an automated message stating that they have a high volume of email they are responding to.  This is the same message I received before when I did not get any other responses.  

Furthermore, I have had issues with a “linked” account and the issue has not been resolved even though when I try to click the link to resolve it, I get a message stating that the account has been “re-linked.”  It has not.  I emailed customer service about this and have not received a response.

The company has grown too big to keep up with customers’ questions, and I am ready to close this account.  There are other apps which do the same as Acorns without charging a monthly fee.  I have given them 2 stars because of the the horrible update and the 2 or 3 times I have emailed my concerns without responses from customer service.  Therefore, they have 3 strikes.

2021-07-22 13:15:20,"I had acorn at the beginning of 2019. At first I thought it was cool and I signed up for their lite package. However, after having it for a few months and yielding little to no results I decided to delete the app. At that time there was no way to talk to customer service because there was no way to reach them. And before you ask yes I searched the app and the I googled their number for a customer service number to no available. I then googled how to shut down my account which of course led me to shutting down my account with them. Or so I thought because in March of 2020 mid pandemic these swindlers started withdrawing from my account again without notice. There was a button in your acorns account that lets you stop them from directly taking your money from your account which I checked off. So acorn your telling me you have the ability to reactivate using my account and take from my banking after I tried to close my account with you? 

And before the developers or whoever reach out to apologize to say I can go get help at blah blah blah.com or call so and so number ya b*tch did. And your customer service didn’t help except HOPEFULLY they actually closed my account this time but who knows I might start getting charged again in 6months or during our next pandemic but I will keep you updated. 

Here was their response to me about getting the money back after months of them charging me without me knowing. 
“ Our records show that a withdrawal was initiated. However, a withdrawal doesn’t close your account, it only liquidates the funds within the account. To close your account, you must visit the “My Subscription” settings in your app or on your desktop. You can also reach out to Acorns Customer Support and request that a member of our team closes your account for you.”

“ To close your account, you must visit the “My Subscription” settings in your app or on your desktop. “ —— 
This doesn’t tell me how to cancel my account fully don’t do this step you will think you are done but you're not just call customer service and tell them you want to cancel it and then call your bank  to stop/flag all payments going to acorn going forward.

My problem with acorns is their disingenuous referral program, where they scam you into signing people up but don’t pay you the big weekly bonuses they promise for doing so. If you happen to sign up the right number of people, make sure you keep their names, phone numbers, and email addresses so in case they ask you to prove it to them that your friends signed up. You must do this even though they send you the $5 referral bonus confirmation emails for the sign ups, within the week specified. I signed up and received the 2 referrals bonuses and met the 2 signee requirements met for two particular weeks where 2 were required for bonuses of $200 and $300. It showed clearly on my app that I received these two sign up bonuses, AND I received email confirmations from those two weeks that I met the requirements, but they never paid out the weeks’ larger bonus. When I inquired why I hadn’t received the bonuses, they told me for a week straight that they needed me to furnish the names, phone numbers, and email addresses of those I signed up. I kept arguing that they had already confirmed on their end that this was the case, and I did indeed show on my app and through my email inbox that the two signees were verified- both within the contest time periods. After arguing this point over and over, for the better part of a week they kept insisting that I needed to show them details that were never stipulated as part of their contest rules (they needed phone numbers, email addresses, my referral code, and the dates I sent the referrals) and ONLY then could they “research” who signed up and when. I kept telling them how preposterous it was that they couldn’t see that they had already credited me the $5 referrals for each week. The final email I received stated that they were somehow miraculously able to “research” my claims and told me that I only signed up two referrals total, even though I’d been paid the $5 referral for FOUR people during those two weeks.

2021-03-29 15:28:57,"I went out of my way to refer four other people to Acorns, who have all invested with the app. I was supposed to be paid $600 for the referrals, per their email offer to me. 

When I attempted to verify the referrals, they made me provide them with the names, phone numbers, emails, referral code, and date that I shared with each of them. 

After jumping through those hoops, they simply said that only two of my referrals used my link and therefore they would not pay me the $600. I then sent screen shots of my texts to each referral, along with texts from my referrals stating that they clicked the link to sign up with Acorns. 

Rather than honoring their offer after I proved that each referral signed up because of me, they chose to hide behind some technicality. They won’t even tell us which of the three didn’t click the link! They just say they didn’t, and that’s that. 

We had intended to use Acorns for the 40+ employees at our company, but this unbelievably short-sighted and pathetic approach to customer service will see us going elsewhere. I would highly recommend using Stash (tons more investment options) or Robinhood (way better service).",1,False,Dublaron21,Absolutely the worst customer service I’ve ever seen,

2021-03-24 22:45:04,"I got Acorns to try some micro investing and they seemed a good choice based on web articles.  

Here is the real deal.  They have 100% outsourced customer service that is undereducated on the product & banking in general.  I tried to deposit a 1300.00 CASHIERS check & they locked me out of my account the same day.  They asked for all sorts of documents, but as the money was gift from a relative, I had no “invoices or paystubs to offer”.  I told them to cancel the transaction and they would not.  It’s been a week and my money is still in limbo.  I keep being told it will be escalated to someone who can decide to unlock my account -has not happened yet.",2,False,Schultz Mama,Beware.

2021-03-09 02:12:34,"Thank you Acorns ! Years ago I was unable to make investments as most companies required substantially large deposits to do so.

For instance, 20 years ago, you had to have approximately 2000.00 to 2500.00 to even open an account. Now that investment companies like acorns are allowing normal folks, who don’t have that much cash on hand to start investing now allow investments with very little cash to start the accounts, I am confident that this will help many people save money for themselves & their families for a better then average future. 

Customer support is second to none, and phone times are very brief, the company has many representatives that answer your questions quickly.And the last customer representative I dealt with was so very exceptional that I wish I had her working with my company ! Take it vantage of the small investment opportunities now, and you will begin to create a better future for yourself your spouse children and grandchildren, I also advise that you teach the young people in your families to invest early so they can enjoy their life’s at much earlier ages. 

Thank you Acorns, you are awesome!

2021-02-10 06:41:06,"Starting to invest was by far the most valuable decision I’ve ever made, I only wish I had started earlier. If Acorns existed in my 20s I would have started sooner because even if you know absolutely nothing about finances or the market you can put money into your acorns account and never really worry about it. Tell them your goals and a little about yourself and for next to nothing your in the market and headed toward your goals.
On top of a solid investment account Acorns also comes with an enormous amount of knowledge and will teach you about investing if you want to learn. The information they have for you is presented in a friendly and easily understood manner. 
If your investment account serves you as well as I know it can’t get also offer a retirement account managed much in the same way as you investment account complete with all the tax benefits that go with a retirement account as well as an incredible spend account that comes with a very handsome tungsten debit cards as well as instant round ups and a great rewards program just for spend money (you’re gonna spend it anyway might as well get something extra for it).
If your a regular working class cool operator like myself, 😎lol, and you hope to amass some wealth in your life then you should absolutely, no question invest your money and let it compound. Unless you’re already wealthy or win the lottery or something then it’s truly the only chance you got and Acorns will do a wonderfully stress free, honest and thorough job of it and they will hardly require much in return. They want you to win, and now thanks to a wealth revolution that has given access to regular hardworking people plus the rise of great financial allies like Acorns to guide people through this great revolution we actually can win!!! 
Thanks Acorns!!!
I know I’ve pretty much had it with the institutions of the system using me for the sole purpose of standing upon my back just to “trickle down” a useless stream of piss on my face and throw me the leftover trash from their dinner tables expecting me to be grateful while they destroy the planet and never really pay a dime in return.
