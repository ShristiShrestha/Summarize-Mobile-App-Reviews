In this economy it’s literally impossible for a 20 year old to save money and getting a car. I grew up poor so it’s not like I could be gifted a car. Nobody is able to give me rides to and from work everyday. Uber you have literally saved my life during times I was struggling most. When I had not even a penny to my name and being consumed in debt. There was always one day where I couldn’t get home. Both of those times I thought I ran out of options. Thinking I’d have to walk 4+ hours home. Knowing I didn’t have a dollar I’d try Lyft, they couldn’t help me. I was super sad and thought all hope was lost. Then I’d tried Uber, it’d say the payment didn’t go through. But on those occasions even when I already had to pay uber back they allowed me to get home. Giving me hope and time to redeem my debts. I literally cried both times it happened. Once in 2020, when the buses stopped running on new years and it was freezing and my clothes were soaking from work, y’all were there to help me out in my time of need. And today, where I’m in a very similar predicament, and thought all hope was lost, y’all were there, to lend me a hand. Thank you so much.",5,False,BEST APP EVER,Will Taft,
2023-03-13 04:37:49,"The minutes shown when you are waiting are wildly inaccurate from reality from my recent experiences. Had a trip where the car was shown after a driver was assigned, to be 3 minutes away. Well two cancellations from drivers later, and another long wait in the cold, the car arrived over 30+ minutes after the first quoted ETA of 3 minutes.  This has happened multiple times.
I have also had several white knuckle moments because the driver had insufficient skills on top of complete unfamiliarity with the route and no ability in speaking or understanding any English.  This causes many problems and has become a critical safety issue when for example a driver made a u turn going the wrong way into three oncoming lanes of traffic on a major four lane artery.  He completely ignored my emphatic alarm because he did not understand a word I said. I expect at a minimum the driver be fluent in the dominant language of the area he is driving in.  I would be equally unhappy to find a taxi driver in Italy who did not speak Italian.  Unless you want to provide a language rating this is unacceptable when my life is at risk in a speeding vehicle with a dangerous driver who may as well be deaf.  I do not care where the driver was born.  But if you are in a business directly interacting with customers in a potentially dangerous service, fluency in English should be a minimum requirement.",3,False,Wait times in app vs reality/Language problems,NoPlanestoSee,
2022-12-23 23:44:26,"Uber is reliable! Met many cool people who can get the job done. Some don’t talk which is fine and very few don’t respect the road. Rides show up on time and get me where I need to go as soon as possible. HOWEVER, this app has good amount of problems. Uber doesn’t do a good job at managing prices. One time this app tried charging me $40 for a 9 min ride home, that’s way out of my price range for a short ride with no traffic and decent weather. Sometimes Uber drivers will make you wait 10-15min then cancel your ride right after. That is the main reason I’m making this review, today just lost 40 min worth of time since I had 3 drivers finish up trips that took around 10-15min and cancelled right after. I could’ve been home within those 40 min I lost. Uber should really do discounts if drivers are going to waste people’s time like that. Also prices are just way out of my price range when it snows. I understand charging more due to weather conditions but sometimes the prices can just be absolutely ridiculous and that’s where Uber becomes unreliable. I love that you can buy bus tickets through this app since it helps save money for how I decide to travel. By all means, DO NOT take this review as an insult! Take this review as criticism and advice to better improve your app and business not just for me but for everyone. Other than that I’ll continue riding with Uber!",3,False,"Overall, VERY reliable.

I had to cancel it 2 to 3 times to find someone who’s competent enough to actually drive and pick me up and take me to my job. I am now going to my job late because one of your drivers decided to sit at a Walmart parking lot for six minutes instead of driving over to pick me up. I am now going to get in trouble with my boss because of this and this is not the first time this has happened. This has happened multiple times with different drivers in a certain occasions it’s with the exact same driver. How can you come and say that you are a company that cares about the customers and yet you have drivers who will sit in the parking lot for 10 minutes and here’s the funny part about that after I canceled it Uber decided to give them my money even though they never picked me up they never did their job.

It’s with uber how are you going to say this app is 4+ in the App Store but you must be 18 technically to order one even though they don’t request for an ID Or nothing maybe I’m mistaken. But also 18 year olds can drive and Can own cars. But teenagers can either not drive or only have there permit. Teenagers can struggle to find rides literally most of my classmates request for Ubers. I understand why it’s 18 for safety but that’s what sharing location is for and the background checks for Uber drivers.

However, last night in Atlanta, I experienced an event that was exceptionally unfair to the driver, shouldn’t have been able to happen, and Uber completely misunderstood the issue and refunded my money instead of solving the problem.
I took a trip from a hotel to a grocery store and bought one reusable bags worth of groceries, including some bottles of water, so it was rather heavy. Hopped in the car, about halfway into the short trip I tip the driver. Once we arrived at the hotel, I had to kind of wrestle with the groceries to get it out of the back of the Tesla model 3. I grabbed my iPhone off the backseat, and since the Uber app was open, I inadvertently canceled the ride. I didn’t realize this until I got into the hotel and was going to rate the driver. The driver had already left the area. I contacted Uber on the help portion of the app, and I received an email asking me for more information. I detailed the story, and this morning I had an email saying we’re sorry you didn’t make it to your destination, and we’re sorry that you were unsatisfied with the driver. It refunded my money. So, the problem was not addressed, and the driver got shafted.

2022-02-21 06:48:54,"Several days ago I ordered an Uber ride from a ride share pick up location in a mall. I saw that the driver made it to the mall but was at the wrong pick up location. This is a very large shopping center with about 8 floors and multiple entrance. He stopped moving for a while so I messaged him to ask how much longer he would be and gave him my exact location. Without responding he canceled my ride. I later found out that I was charged a fee even though I didn’t cancel the ride. I first disputed this charge on the app, to which I received an Uber credit/cash for. There’s no way to contact customer support so I left a complaint for the driver and left a message explaining what he did. I stated that if Uber did not refund my original form of payment I would dispute the charge. Minutes later I received a response explaining that they will refund the charge on my credit card.
Never again. Why would they allow drivers to do this with no repercussions? I was late to my meeting and what made it so frustrating is that the driver was so close but at the wrong pick up location. The problem could’ve been resolved had he just replied to my message. He did not make any attempt to communicate with me.

When I told her I would miss my flight if I had to wait for another driver she didn’t care, she just repeated “I can’t take you to the airport”.  Two problems with this situation: 1) why doesn’t Uber tell drivers the destination of their passenger before they accept the trip and make the passenger wait 15 mins before denying them???  2) when I tried to file a complaint against the driver there was absolutely no way to do this because it wasn’t logged as a trip in my history (due to the driver denying my trip at pickup).  There is zero way to call somebody or even email somebody unless it’s tied to a trip in your history.

Just another example of disappearing customer service.  You waste tons of time on the app trying to find a way to talk to a human (novel idea) to only find out there’s no way to do this.

However, the last ride was disappointing and followed by an unexpected and utterly unwarranted clean-up fee. First, the driver tried to drop her off at a nearby intersection instead of at her house, even though it was late at night. The whole point of getting an Uber was to get home safely, and riders shouldn’t have to ask to get dropped off at the actual drop-off location. Then in the morning, we were horrified, outraged, and baffled to see that a huge cleaning fee was added to the fare. I had been on the phone and texting her before, during, and after the trip. She did not vomit in the car, nor did she even bring food or drinks in the car. She left the car in the same condition in which she entered it: mess-free. Moreover, I still have a 5-star rating, which wouldn’t make sense if my friend had left a mess in the car. So…riders, beware! It wouldn’t occur to me to take pictures of the car before and after, but maybe it is necessary to take such precautions to avoid scams.

I heard that Uber car drivers are sent a job, click accept and after the fact learn the destination. At this point they simply cancel if they don’t want to go there while the person who ordered the Uber has to wait an additional 10-15 minutes for another Uber car and is charged a cancellation fee. If you have an important time sensitive meeting or doctors appointment like we had you are up the creek. What kind of backwards thinking is Uber using?! We have also had issues with Uber drivers picking up in the wrong location. We provide the exact address where we are and they are way down the block where we can’t see them.

On top of that their customer service is literally the worst I’ve ever experienced. Maybe 1/10 experiences were easy and straight forward. The rest were filled with an app that makes getting support as annoying and complicated as possible. And when you did get through you get cut and paste prompts that clearly came from a manual and didn’t address your issue at all. Like not even close to the topic you contacted them for.   8/10 reps were very poorly trained, regularly gave me conflicting and completely inaccurate information, had poor customer service skills and were wildly inefficient in getting you to a resolution. I was a regular customer and they still were so difficult.  If I was driving I would have deleted this app awhile ago. Uber’s way of doing business is so disrespectful to it’s riders and drivers have regularly complained of their upsetting and difficult experiences with Uber as well.

The first one the food was spoiled the second never came. I did order late at night so my phone was on silent and missed the delivery person’s call despite watching the app closely to see when he arrived and showing up at the door when the app said it was here. I was sick and ordered soup so this really made my night worse as I did not have it in me to cook so I ended up going to bed hungry after already feeling like garbage. There was no one out there and no food left at my door. Sure someone could’ve stolen it in the seconds it took for me to check my door (I live in a city) however our block is quiet and I’ve never had food stolen before. It seems to me the delivery guy kept it for himself and because he called me twice and I didn’t answer he then got free food on my dime. They refused to refund me for this reason.

But think about it this is neither the driver or the passengers fault that would point directly to Uber. Second is Since I’ve used Uber over 100 times I’ve noticed that every driver uses Google maps or Apple Maps not the app navigation. I am not a Driver so I cannotReview the navigation on it but I do know however that the location is very off for pick ups and to mention the pinpoint location feature is pointless this could be improved  dramatically.

I waited over half an hour as it the app kept saying wait time is 8 or 13 minutes and when I called the driver to assist with directions I got no answer.

Secondly to my understanding the Uber driver asked was he called my son by name and my son said yes but later he asked my son was he another individual which my son said No that’s when the Uber driver said he had reached his drop off area which was not his job he go’s to every single day!!!!! Instead my son got out of the vehicle and phone me mind you it’s so early that nothing is open so he’s out there in the cold walking!!!!!!!!! I would have took my son myself to work but of course I can’t see at night!!!! But because I knew it was dangerously cold out and dangerous in general I dug my vehicle out from the snow and picked my son up!!!! It cost him 25 dollars every day just to get to work and he never got there!!!!! Anything horrible thing could have happened to him and there is nothing absolutely nothing Uber could tell me!!!!!!

Yesterday I get a notification of an 73 dollar charge from Uber! Utterly confused, I noticed it was from my most previous trip. My driver literally kept asking me directions instead of using the app, tried to find a WaWa to get him some coffee three different times during my trip AND I ended up having to give him instructions to get me back home from the WaWa near my house. He bought me a coffee to makeup for it, but these were not MY requested stops on MY app. I shouldn’t be held accountable for his negligence of fares/fee to then only to have to go back and pay AGAIN when I technically already paid once. I shouldn’t have to re-pay for a week old ride because Uber didn’t pay attention to the ride details or contacted their own driver about the “distance” change. 

We’re in a pandemic. People aren’t working. People are on strict budgets. I don’t have the funds nor time to deal with this. Suppose it took that $70 from my account if I had it?

For example you could offer a quiet ride for those who have social anxiety and prefer to not converse, as well as a low sensory feature for those individuals who suffer from sensory overload and other similar triggers. This would make your service more accessible to all rather than few. Another great addition would be love agent texting through the app if the passenger(s) feel unsafe at anytime. That way they could walk you through the proper steps and alert the proper authorities if needed for you.

This is completely unacceptable in my opinion. The way I see it, you are providing a service and this is what you sign up to do. I as a customer have to pay a premium to get anywhere and I find it so frustrating that I can’t rely on a driver to actually pick me up. Several times I have waited over 20 minutes just for a driver to cancel on me. It makes the app unusable.

Minor issue but it becomes tedious when reserving 5-10 rides at a time every week. I hope that the Uber app developers fix this bug soon as it has been like this for a few months now.

Bug 2: Today my driver was early for my scheduled ride. Therefore, I was under the impression that I could perhaps leave work early and get to my destination a little faster. However, instead I sat in the car with my driver for more than 5 minutes before we left the pickup spot because the app does not let the driver begin the ride more than 10 minutes before the scheduled pickup time.

I used to pay $8-$12 sometimes $15 just to go from my house to work and now I can’t even afford to go to work. It isn’t that helpful. While I understand the drivers need to get paid, the more expensive you create ur prices the more you will lose customers because nobody can afford to pay that much 5 days out of a week just to go to a job to support themselves. I literally sit on the app for 3 hours hoping the prices will decrease and change but they don’t they just get higher and higher every time I open the app. I can’t keep riding with a company that wants to charge me $30 every time I need to go 10 min down the street for a job to create a living.

I talked with a driver recently and learned that instead of Uber assigning the closest driver for your ride, they allow drivers to snag up any ride on a first come first serve basis, regardless of their distance from the rider. This has resulted in ridiculous wait times for rides, to the point that I’m waiting 25 minutes for my driver to arrive for a 10 minute drive. Uber allowed me to cancel my ride in lieu of requesting a new driver once, but that was the only grace. Now, I am forced to wait ridiculous wait times for short drives unless I want to pay a fee for cancelling the ride and looking for a new driver.

One time I spent nearly an hour on the phone trying to guide an angry driver to my house, because the GPS simply doesn’t work, and they got mad at me for it. No customer or driver should have to deal with something like this malfunctioning when it’s so important to the process. I already did my part to check if my address was correct, and I actually made it a habit to put my address into the comment box to prevent this issue, which wouldn’t work because according to the drivers, “regardless of the address I put in, it’s taking me to a different area”. 

It’s unprofessional. Plain and simple. And I’m definitely only gonna use Uber if I absolutely have to. I mean seriously? It’s an app designed to drive people to their desired destinations, or for food delivery. But….the GPS doesn’t even work? 

Also, I’d like to mention: DO NOT GET UBER ONE FOR RIDES.

I have no idea why the initial suspension occurred as I am just a regular user - taking rides when traveling and on vacation. I have continued to use Lyft with no issues and have never been suspended from anything before so the mystery still remains. I used to use Postmates frequently, but lost that once it came under the Uber umbrella. I’m fine without them as I can use Lyft, Doordash etc but am annoyed because I feel like something must have compromised my account. I also just recently asked to be reactivated again and someone from CS wrote back that it was taken care of and there was a misunderstanding on my account but as soon as I tried to place an UberEats order, it failed and the suspension came back. I emailed CS again and the answer was that I would continue to be suspended. I travel a lot - enough to have status on multiple airlines and access to all airport lounges - so not having Uber as an alternative option to Lyft when needed is an annoyance.

I couldn’t possibly read his plate and there were 5 or so cars between us stopped as his car was still not to curb. There were no cars at curb in front of me and outside lane was open except for him blocking it, and I was standing waving my arms, It took maybe 2 minutes to roll our bags down to where he stopped half blocking the out side lane as he waited for cars at curb to move. I was amazed I was charged a “wait time” fee as. I had hustled down to his stop point.  I had initiated tracking not sure why he stopped short but I guess GPS can do that. If I knew I had been charged a lousy wait fee I wouldn’t have tipped him $15   
$120 was $20 higher than a limo I took a few months ago. Really bad experience for the rate hike. No tolls or anything I was aware of, Driver was friendly and good driver unless he had something to do with wait fee! No way did he have to wait! I may try lift next time.

2022-06-12 18:10:32,"Uber used to be much better and more reliable. Driver cancellations are a much worse problem than before. Me and many of my friends have been left stranded for 30min-1hr, in potentially unsafe situations, because multiple drivers have cancelled on us. When that happens, Uber hikes the quoted price on us. Uber should be responsible for making up the difference if their initially quoted bids don’t clear. This is blatant disregard for the customer experience and borderline exploitation, where the price paid is often updated in-ride or before the ride without the rider accepting the new price. I would recommend Lyft over Uber, even if it takes a few more minutes, because at least they care about their customers.

Drivers as a whole are unreliable and will cancel or ignore your ride requests regularly, while the app keeps your price the same. Also surges seem

He charged me five dollars for a cancellation fee for a trip that I never booked. This is the scariest part. The five dollars was actually charged through my Uber account. I don’t know how he connected my account with my husbands or why Uber would allow this type of behavior.

 Uber is almost impossible to contact! And I have tried several ways and they just keep sending a prefabed message saying they are refunding my money. I really don’t care about the five dollars at all. I am much more concerned about the breach of the system. I have contacted them almost every day since this happened six days ago.

A friend of mine mine who used to drive for Uber told me some drivers don’t respond to the call intentionally right away because they will get a higher fare if they wait. The price is determined by the amount of the demand. So Uber and the driver benefit by pretending to be busy. The price doubled in 10 minutes. I was so surprised to find out what he told me is true. He said some drivers have figured out it’s more profitable to not respond right away and groups of them hang out together to drive the price up. So wrong. I wonder if lifts prices are also determined by availability of drivers versus how many people are waiting for a ride. This is a demand driven scale for pricing. And a ripoff. They need to either change the price scale and or stop the drivers from hanging out until the price doubles. Note not all drivers are doing this. Some are honest good people.

I am a avid user of ride sharing apps with over 200+ rides with Uber since starting. 

The problem is they get really greedy with the pricing. Ask any driver and have an open discussion about the cost of the trip vs what the driver makes and you will find a big disparity in what you pay vs what the drivers make.

The other red flag with Uber is how they handle spot pricing. If you call an Uber right before a surge pricing event occurs in your area you are immediately deprioritized from nearby drivers and the app will force you to rebook at a higher fee. I just had this happen to me today where I agreed to pay $38 dollars to get home. After 15 minutes of waiting I cancelled the ride and looked again only to find my $38 fare was now increased to $46! Frustrated, I installed Lyft to see what the cost to go home would be and it was $33! Checked back to Uber after installing Lyft only to find Uber had completely jacked the cost of my ride home upward $60!!!! >:(

If the rider/user cancels they charge us a fee, but if the driver cancels we don’t get a discount or anything. We just waste our time.

After being cancelled on twice, we ended up getting an Uber almost an hour after we booked it by using a different account. 
We may have been less upset if the drivers cancelled in a timely manner, but both drivers cancelled when they were supposedly less than 10 minutes away.

One bit of functional improvement would be to allow a note to be input when selecting the pickup location... like a hotel room number or other note.

2023-10-16 21:26:15,"The Uber app does not work very well in Brazil. Drivers cancel rides frequently after picking them up—there should be a driver penalty for this. It wastes everyone’s time, and prevents the ride from being available to other drivers, extending the wait time. 

Other times drivers will accept a ride and then sit still for a while instead of driving. I have noticed this because I’ve been on the street waiting for a ride and I can see the entire block. They have been sitting still without moving. With no traffic. 

But the worst issue I have had repeatedly is that a driver will drop me off without ending the ride on his side of things. Then the ride will continue indefinitely, and Uber sides with the driver, stating that I was not dropped off at my actual destination. I have had to file multiple disputes for this. If they are going to take the drivers word for it that I got out at a different destination when it is actually the driver that is continuing to drive just to bill extra money, that is not fair.

The simple fix for this, which often happens in the US, is that if I wish to change the final destination, the driver requires me to enter it into the app for the sake of transparency. Please fix this in Brazil.

2022-09-12 16:08:16,"Here’s the thing, the app “works” just fine. There are small things like it doesn’t work with Apple CarPlay, if it is plugged into your car the sound can get all outta whack and get quieter and louder for no reasons, sometimes it crashes out of nowhere… all that is annoying but no big deal.

 The real flaw with this thing is the way you accept a delivery. 

The button to accept a delivery is in the EXACT same spot as when you want to type a quick message to the person your delivering too therefore, you can be typing a message like “have a great day” and while you type that, a delivery can pop up and you just ok’d a $2.80 delivery that is 6 miles away and will take 18 minutes of your day. That’s the biggest flaw in the app by far. 

How to fix this: 
- move the accept button to a different part of the screen (especially when already on a delivery)
- have double confirmation instead of just one tap to accept and move on, there’s a tap to see the info and a tap to accept.
- make the accept button a “slide to accept” instead of “tap.” (This is how every other button works in the app (almost) but this seems to me to be the best way.

I started pivoting towards Uber because they were starting to become cheaper in my area. Almost immediately, I had a negative experience.

I was waiting to get picked up to go to an appointment, and one of their drivers started harassing me through the messaging interface. At first, I was confused because I didn’t even realize there was an option to communicate from within the app. Then, I noticed that they were parked somewhere and not moving while they were insulting and berating me for having a low rating as a passenger (which I’m not sure how I got because I’d had maybe five rides at that point).

I decided the safest thing for me to do was, as a single woman who travels alone, to cancel the ride. It just isn’t worth the risk. I called a friend and they gave me a ride instead.

Because according to Uber, you are more likely to not pass on a ride, and wait for a better fair, if your battery is low and you must get home to charge it. When asked about this in an interview, the Uber CEO smirked and called it an interesting take on the human psyche. Screw him. I use Uber much less after seeing him say that on video.

Why? 
1) Uber drivers cancel rides after they accepted it and you have waited for them for a prolonged time - Wasting your precious time at the very least, but many times your money too. Since they often charge you a cancellation fee. 
2) this is a widespread problem (Google it) yet the company does not provide you with a customer service or an option to put such complaint on their site. (As if they are unaware of it)
3) the fact that Uber doesn’t take any serious steps to fight this means that in one way or other this works in their favor. And they don’t want to antagonize their precious drivers. 
4) they will refund your money if you ask for it. But then you not only wasted 5-10 minutes waiting for the car that never arrives, you also wasted another 5-10 minutes figuring out how to file a complaint and get a refund. (This is not one their standard quick list of problems).

2023-08-22 17:05:16,"To be honest, there's a lot to appreciate about this app and its service offerings. Not only does it facilitate ride-sharing, but it also empowers individuals to create their own job opportunities and provides a platform for growth.

While some drivers might not always meet expectations, and occasional issues like missing items occur, it's commendable that Uber is open to feedback and responsive to customer concerns. I appreciate the reliability of the service.

The only aspect that can be frustrating is when drivers take a while to cancel, or even cancel when they're nearby, potentially causing a chain reaction. Despite this occasional inconvenience, I've found that someone usually comes through to provide the service eventually. Given the competitive nature of the platform, it would be great to see more discounts available, even for less frequent users. Times can be tough, and having more affordable options would be appreciated.

Years ago, living in London, I remember being horrified by the cost of getting a taxi. I was a reasonable well paid management consultant but taking a black can from Zone 1 to 2 at the end of an evening felt it hollowed me out. 

The technology behind Uber is great but I want to celebrate the customer service. When things go wrong, they do a pretty excellent job in making amends. Refunds are fast. There are few quibbles.

This was the only time I struggled to fix something - and eventually got there with the help of someone at VP level who I contacted blindly on LinkedIn.

I have been a long time customer of Uber and Uber Eats. Today I canceled my Uber Gold membership. Their response to my cancellation prompted me to write this. 

To keep it short and sweet, last night there was an ice storm. I placed an order through Uber Eats, the estimated delivery time was 20-30 minutes. 

The merchant didn’t send the order out for delivery until over an hour after I placed it, and because I was sick in bed and grieving the death of my mother, I was asleep by the time it arrived. My bad, but I could not have gotten it anyway, as it was left out in the snow and I could not open my front door that late due to frozen ice.

Given circumstances, I politely requested a refund, as my order was inedible after it arrived. Uber Support claimed “actions outside the merchant’s control” caused the delay and refused to issue a refund. 

They responded with the same canned email 4 times, refused to address any of my concerns or actually give a human response. I said I understood their stance but would be canceling my membership due to the poor experience. 

Their “priority service team” responded with the EXACT SAME CANNED EMAIL and said nothing about any concerns I had raised.

You can also add stops when heading to your destination which is great when your needing some groceries or to pay a bill before going home.

First, I would like to say, since the app started, it has made traveling to new places very easy. Thank you for that.

However, there are some things I would like point out. The definition of an extra large vehicle is not correct. Please view the list of what an XL vehicle is.

1) Van
2) SUV
3) Mini Van

These vehicles can fit four or more grown adults with bags comfortably and still with in the lines of safety.

Regular vehicle.

1) Mini SUV
2) Car
3) Hatch back
4) other vehicles smaller than Van, Mini Van and SUV.

Common issue I have is, I request an XL vehicle and get a mini SUV. A mini SUV even with more than 5 seats is not a large enough vehicle to fit more than 3 grown adults with bags comfortably and safely. A large amount of time the people that sit in the back seat end up sitting on the vehicle door due to lack of space and it makes it very difficult to wear a seatbelt.

I would like to recommend that UBER puts an options in for people who have a large family and had lots of bags.

Please take this into consideration for I am really starting to not want to use UBER any long because I have to cancel my UBER due to someone owning a mini SUV and cannot handle four grown adults with bags.

When initially inquiring, they said “$40 fees come as a result of a MODERATE EXTERIOR mess.” The photo of the “mess” that was sent to me was dust and dirt on a foot mat INSIDE the car. Once I pointed this out, I did not receive any response from any customer support agent.

Uber needs to 1) show drivers the end destination before they accept a trip and 2) pay them more so they aren’t incentivized to cancel if it is inconvenient for them. 

One of the drivers said if he wasn’t short on time he would have made the trip if I paid him in cash.  The price he offered was half that of the Uber cost. So, they must be paying these drivers little to nothing on these trips.

2023-11-04 18:02:55,Years ago Uber used to be a great and safe way to traverse but between creeps trying to snatch people and the reckless drivers they hire it’s not longer the ideal option for travel anymore. Customer service also used to take safety and satisfaction way more seriously. I don’t know if I just got a bad rep but my driver was going 70 in 45 mph zones. Was swerving onto the side of the road and in and out of traffic and drove very closely to cars to the point where they had to sudden break constantly. No compensation was offered nor was there any reassurance that they’re going to take hiring safer drivers more seriously so this doesn’t happen again. 0/10 won’t be riding again.

However, at times such services can cause stress.   It seems that complaints other than the preset complaints are not permitted.  

For example, how does one complain about the delayed time of arrival after the time has been?  One selects, for example, a $9:67 ride that offers to arrive in 5 minute.  But once selected, the time of arrival changes to 8 minutes.  
Because of this , I once selected a “wait and save ride” that actually arrived sooner than a standard ride; and I saved a dollar.

Or

I select a ride that says will arrive in 1 minute, but I waits for 5 minutes or longer as the “1 minute to arrive” time doesn’t move.

Obviously, rates vary according to time of arrival.  But if I select a ride to pick me up sooner than later and pay for it,  how is it that I get picked up later, but my rate remains the same?

Here are several ideas to make the User/ Rider even more EXCLUSIVELY IMPORTANT like Four Seasons Hotel:

#1: Rider should have the year they started riding with Uber. (5 year Rider 🌟)

#2: Rider should be able to have Rating quantities like the driver has “5 Star 5000 trips.

#3: Rider should have personality Ratings. Such  as :A) Read Books 📚 B) Music listener 🎧 C) Grocery Shopper D) Quiet 🤫 E) Conversationalist 

#4) A link to FB when traveling /check in Uber and when you check in - it will shower your Status: “Diamond RIDER” Check in Uber Rider in NYC . Like when you check in a restaurant or other. 

#5) goes with #4.....Get rewarded for checking in. That way you get free advertisement and we get points that lead to $7.00 rewards towards rides etc.

I am having a more difficult time getting drivers at San Diego airport. Sometimes I get multiple drivers who apparently cancel when they see I need to go to Carlsbad in North County, San Diego, about a 35-40 minute drive.

This is getting to the point to where I am forced to look at other ways to get back and forth to the airport. Not sure what is going on, but if I cannot get reliable service with Uber, I will simply use another solution.

2.  Once the prospective rider has booked the ride and made the payment, the rider should get some receipt or payment confirmation right away.  If the payment has not been deducted yet, Uber must inform the rider when it will deducted.  

Thanks!",4,False,First Experience with Uber,jjjurgen,
2021-02-19 17:45:57,There are drivers on the app that will be available to ride but will decline the ride for unknown reasons. This is incredibly insensitive towards customers and people that really need help getting around. I’ve been trying to get around to get food and groceries but there is this same driver on the app showing that he/she is available but refuses to accept my ride. I’ve grown to strongly dislike this app. IF THE DRIVERS DONT WANT TO ACCEPT RIDES THEN THEY SHOULDNT BE ON THE APP! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CITY BUS OVER THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR HELP. HOW ARE YOU HELPING PEOPLE IF YOUR DRIVERS REFUSE TO HELP THEM WHEN NEEDED?!,1,False,Terrible Customer Service And Drivers.,trelltyyyyyy,
