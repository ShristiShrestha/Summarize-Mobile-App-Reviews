I don’t need to tell you about convenient stores it takes more than 5 minutes sometimes. However, Rob dropped me off. Made a u-turn, while I was in the store, so I could be picked up at the front door. Simple things like that are why I tip to my gig workers. They don’t get much for gas. And the $3 isn’t enough. So you riders out there. I challenge you if you have $$ on you, give it. If not put it into the tips portion. This isn’t Yellow Cab anymore.

9/3/2023 6:52,Omg. I decided to come to Padukah for the Labor Day weekend plus I got a chance to see the Tillman vs mayfield game which was awesome. However I decided that since it’s a holiday weekend and who’s got time for a DUI. I decided to be responsible and call for a Lyft because Uber was so either short staffed or something but I couldn’t even reserve a ride so I decided to call for a Lyft.

I do use this app often because it’s connected to my Delta rewards and when I travel it’s a great & reliable app to move around the states.

11/15/2022 20:06,My mom has been a Lyft driver for at least 1 to 2 years. She did everything in her power to keep customer reviews up and followed all rules and regulations from Lyft. This job was easy for her due to her back pain and having to deal with many issues we had going on. That was until Lyft kicked her out closing her account. They kept on saying there was a flag on her account when she went to look there wasn’t. She tried to contact them several times but they never had any form of contact.

The app does not ask about number of bags that you have for getting to and from the airport, so we weren’t sure if the vehicle would accommodate our needs.

I googled for ways to contact Lyft, or our assigned driver, but the two things that I did come across, neither one applied in reality. There should at least be able available a way to chat with someone to assuage any concerns.

Lyft needs to do better matching drivers and riders or maybe offer a penalty when a driver bails at the last minute. Update: there’s a big problem with scheduling rides. I requested a ride at the airport and locked in a price and was told I’d be assigned a driver within 7 minutes once I’m at the pickup area. I waited in the pickup area for 15 minutes and nothing changed. I eventually canceled it because there wasn’t a driver coming and I needed to get home.

10/16/2023 14:46,I’m highly disappointed with the way Lyft forces you to download the app. In case of emergencies you can’t order a lyft AT ALL without having the app. I went online to try and schedule a Lyft due to having a broken windshield and unable to drive my vehicle at the time. As an emergency I went on to my web browser to order a lift and to my surprise I was unable to due to the fact that I could not download the app on my phone at the time. In the midst of stress and trying to find a windshield replacement it made it entirely more stressful and frustrating to feel stranded. Due to the fact that I’m not a regular Lyft customer or someone who doesn’t want an unnecessary app to take up space on my phone.

It took hours but after making a police report and talking to Lyft support and trying to contact the driver myself a multitude of times, my bag was returned with items missing. Lyft then charged me another 15 dollars on top of my ride fee for the driver having to “take time out of their day” to return my belongings.

Then i saw a driver drop off a passenger and then he was waiting there, so I checked the car license plate on the app and turns out it's the same car assigned to me. Awesome right?
No. The driver cancelled, since i could literally see his car I waved at him and told him I just got assigned to him and he informed he that Lyft was paying him super less for this ride and hence he cancelled. 
Then it made sense to me. Lyft was undercutting the driver to give an attractive price for the driver. If this happened with one driver I'd believe it's on the driver and not Lyft. But 4 (or 5 I can't exactly tell) drivers doing the same, this is most likely company policy. This is pathetic. I would give Lyft 0 star if I could.

One driver even stopped outside my house and as I was walking down the driveway with my suitcase, he must have realized and drove off.  He cancelled the ride and left me standing there.  Took 20 mins for next time driver to arrive, which is a lot when you need to get to the airport.

None of this is the driver’s fault.

I waited until 10:35 and never received the normal updates such as he was on his way, close, etc.   He never showed up.   For someone nervous about an impending surgery this made me very anxious.   I set up another ride and my driver was given my pick up address as a block over.   Luckily I had been sent his phone number and location updates so I called him to explain the problem.   He was curtious and kind and understood that I was anxious because I was now late for my surgical arrival.   He drove safely yet intently and got me there only 10 minutes late.

Therefore, this became a really good time to try Lyft.  My daughter raves about Lyft so I said let’s give it a go!  The long shirt of it all, I downloaded the app, and it was a seamless process .  I did all the necessary things to book a car and voilà.  I was able to get a car for a fraction of what Uber was charging and I got a blk xl with the VIP treatment.

Even when scheduling early this still is a major issue. In addition, reaching out to customer service does not always help, sometimes they just relay that there is nothing they can do, lacking empathy. I just wish there were higher expectations. Not to mention the pricing has gone up with a reduction in quailing. I use Uber as well because I can’t trust Lyft to get me where I need to go in a timely manner.

3/27/2023 17:40,"There’s a couple of things that are very wrong with Lyft. One thing is that just about every driver wants to discuss politics and religion. That’s messed up and nobody needs that. The other thing is that they charge you an unreasonable price for some rides and that make no sense. They say is availability, I say it’s a ripoff, and on top of that, they ask you for a tip. If you demand for me to pay triple the price for the same ride don’t ask for a tip. That’s price gauging. That’s a slap in the face. 

Change your ways or someone else will come along that’s going to look at this treatment of customers, and bit you at your own game by providing a better service, and please, get rid of the crazy drivers!

The issue I encounter with Lyft (Uber on the rare occasion too) is it takes ages to find a driver if you lucky. It takes a good 25+ minutes of searching before exiting out each time. Also it finds 5 drivers in a 4 minute window, which all are 2-3 minutes away. How is there no drivers in a big city ? Or why it switches to 5-7 different drivers in less than 5 minutes? I can kinda understand during a holiday or maybe a weekend/night but not middle of the day. At that point I have to switch ride sharing apps for it to work. What I can see as a solution to fix this issue is to have a timer for 1 minute or so and if no one accepts it within that time, the app will automatically do a 1 minute countdown and if no one accepts in the countdown then the app will accept it for the closest driver and they can’t decline it without paying a $10 fee.

This charged me an additional $5 which doesn’t matter however the ride came in 11 minutes.

I left a review on the app stating how the car was dirty, had a foul smell and cockroaches however this only led to calling the lyft support number. The lyft support agent answered and I provided my information then explained what had happened to only be placed on hold for 15 minutes which led to being hung up on and never called back again.

11/29/2022 22:54,"I requested a scheduled ride this morning to the Tampa airport for 6:30. The app told me they would be there between 6:25-6:35. They arrived at 6:15 and when I told them I needed ten minutes because they were early he said ok and then left leaving me stranded and charged me a 10 dollar cancellation fee. I had to order another Lyft which almost made me miss my flight. That’s totally unacceptable that I was charged $47 dollars for a ride that never happened. If you don’t pay attention to this I will never use Lyft again. I’m a good customer and have never complained before but this is wrong. The driver was in the wrong for coming too early and leaving when I told him he was early and I needed 10 minutes. He just left. If you think this is professional service you’re mistaken and I will lodge a formal complaint and put a hold on my credit card as a incorrect charge. I thought Lyft was better then Uber but I was mistaken. Reverse the no show fee and he and Lyft got paid twice. If you look I immediately had to request another ride so I didn’t miss my flight. Why would I cancel? Please respond to this request with a human.

I “reserved” a Lyft ride the day before which means I paid extra money to make sure it arrived on time to get me to the airport early bc the security lines are extremely long on the morning flights. I booked a 3:35am Lyft for my 6:10am flight and the first Lyft driver Jey was on his way only 5 minutes from my home & he canceled. I had to wait an extra 30 minutes for another Lyft which made me LATE getting to the airport waiting an hour in the security line. Thank God for Lyft driver Shannon for taking my drive to get me safely to the airport. She was kind, curious, great driver & awesome car. I gave her 5 STARS but very disappointed in the Lyft system canceling on me at the last minute, with an extra cost reservation & making me late to the airport on my very first Lyft ride.

6/30/2023 9:30,"I scheduled a Lyft ride while changing planes at the airport in Vegas so I wouldn’t have to wait and order one at 3am when I landed in Nashville. I texted the driver the minute I touched down and said I was speed walking to the pickup but Lyft made him cancel because I wasn’t there in the 10min window. A 10min window for a PRE scheduled ride (when you know I’m coming on a plane from another state) needs to have more than a 10min window! I added 15min onto my landing time but I have no control over the plane’s delay while I’m air and I can’t adjust my time while I’m flying! It was a good “fare” (long drive and big tip) and given that it was 250am and I was exhausted I don’t understand why if the driver wanted to wait for me he wasn’t allowed 🤬.  I didn’t get into a car until 330am as they then changed cars on me 3 times and didn’t get to my destination until 415am. 

Uber is more expensive but at least they ask your flight info and have a longer “courtesy wait time” (which should be standard when you’re pre-booking based on an airlines projected landing time!).

I selected the next driver because I had a flight leaving. The fee was outlandish but the first driver made this my only choice and he responded to me and was there quickly.

Instead, I was continuously told I wasn’t overcharged and that fares increase when extra stops are added to a trip. However, no matter how many times I said the problem was that I was dropped at the wrong location, they wouldn’t even acknowledge the actual problem. 

In the end, they simply said they can’t issue a refund (no explanation despite me asking) but would offer a $5 credit. So… their solution was to “give” me back my own money they didn’t earn, and “return” it in a way that will only allow me to give my money back to them. Horrible. I’ve permanently deleted my account.

I ignored it since he probably had a long day and i didn’t complain at all about it because, i mean come on, that would probably embarrass him. But the issue was the constant nagging about me having a husband and then making non stop passes and disgusting remarks. I got so tired of it i asked him to pull over to let me out and i would rather walk the 10mi back. Bro when i tell you he did not stop and locked the doors, i had to pull my tazer out and BUZZ BUZZ click that bad boy a few times. When he saw i was not with the games i got out the vehicle and took the appropriate steps to report it.

We tried resolving this issue but due to time constraints (we did not want to miss our flight while waiting for Lyft to send us another car) we had to somehow accommodate the bags in that same car. We cramped ourselves in the back seat for the entire journey. This was exactly the reason we had pre scheduled a XL car and not the standard one. It was not drivers fault as she did not know that we ordered XL ride and she was very nice let us ride. This is completely unacceptable that we paid premium ($49 for XL) for our safety and ordered bigger car so we should not face any issues.

I was in the middle of a ride and the driver was confused as to where we were going because it just had a city. When I tried to input my address, it couldn’t be found. I had been using Lyft over Uber because of the rewards from using my credit card, so it was really weird that it all of a sudden lost and couldn’t find my address or any address in my neighborhood. I had to get dropped off at a local Target and Uber home. Also, why can’t you pinpoint your pickup and drop off locations?  

I just got a free subscription to pink through my credit card. Still can’t find my address, but at least it has my street name. Before booking, the map shows multiple cars in close proximity “within 1 minute”, then they all disappear and it takes 20 minutes to find a car 12 minutes away. I get messages of “we’re contacting drivers.” Of course, the driver doesn’t know where to go and has to circle around for another 4 minutes.

The app is generally very intuitive and easy to use, with one major exception: if you are scheduling a pick up in a time zone different from the one you are in when you are scheduling the pick up, Lyft will modify the pick up time according to the difference between the two time zones.
I recently traveled from mountain time to central time and selected a pick up time of 9:40 PM at my destination. Lyft adjusted the pick up time +1 hour. This left me waiting in the airport and parking garage for about an extra 40 minutes. It would have been longer, but the driver was early, thankfully.
Lyft should schedule rides according to the times the riders request in the time zone of the pickup. Obviously.
I can’t imagine what their logic is, adjusting the time zone in the way that they do. This is not consistent with travel time notation used by airlines, or any other transportation service.

1/10/2023 19:24,"Drivers have been scamming riders by causing damage to their own car AFTER the rider gets out, and then charging the rider with the damage fee. I am out $80 because of it. The only evidence the driver provided were blurry photos of a spilled beer bottle (we did not have any drinks in the car) with a time stamp long after the ride was over. I provided sufficient evidence that this driver was scamming us and had several witness statements to prove it.  Per their policy for drivers “you will not attempt to Lyft or riders on the Lyft platform”, but when it came to customer service, this policy was ignored. Lyft has been made aware of this scam for years yet has taken no action to correct it or to protect their riders. I contacted customer service several times, but they did not answer my questions and considered the case resolved when it was not.

The drive finally gets to me and passed me right up after looking me right in my face. I get the notification that he’s “here and leaving I’m 5 minutes” I call and tell him he’s at the wrong area and he gives me the b.s. response of his gps messing up. I describe what I have on and he says ok I will be there. I even gave him a landmark. He’s only 1 minute away and it’s taking forever. He then cancels the trip and passes by me again within the next 3 minutes but continues looking straight ahead. I truly feel like it was the color of my skin. I don’t like jumping to conclusions but it’s natural for me to think this way.

10/27/2022 21:50,"The customer service is awful! I got a lyft ride a few days ago and I am sure that  I chose the option of ‘wait and save’ For which the app showed me that the charge of the ride will be $7 but unexpectedly they charged me $16 after the ride was finished! I contacted the customer service and asked for refund. They told me that I chose the option of “priority pick up” and they don’t refund me!!! It is unbelievable that they charged me extra while I am 100% sure that I did choose the wait and save option and they do not do any investigation!! They could charge me $300 and don’t accept their fault later!!! Be careful that they can charge you an arbitrary amount because they have access to your credit card! 

My another bad experience with the lyft and its awful customer service: I got a lyft ride for my old aunt a few days ago. She is old and the driver deceived her and told her that the cost of the ride has not been paid and asked $25 (while the actual cost was $23 and I paid that in the app when I requested the ride). She paid $25 in cash. After I got to know this I reported the issue to lyft . The only answer that they gave me was that “we don’t assign this driver to you again”!!!

1/12/2023 13:54,I scheduled a ride the night before. Had many vehicle issues to take care of and some appointments to be handled. Hence why I scheduled ahead. The scheduled driver never showed up. Help center never even showed driver so I couldn’t dispute the issue and charge to was put on my card from cancelling. Then the app offered to switch drivers which I selected to. The app changed my pick up address and would not let me change it in any way! It wouldn’t even let me cancel the ride. Eventually the driver was able to cancel once I contacted them and asked them to. I had to wait roughly 30 minutes for my next driver to show because of having to resubmit a ride request from prior issues. During that time the customer support were basic questions that didn’t address my issue or dispute and no way of contacting a person to discuss this problem that occurred. I don’t know if it was or is a glitch in the app but this reminded me why I deleted the app to being with.

I recently had a driver who was being exceptionally strange and was driving erratically. When I asked him if there was a problem and expressed that I just wanted to get home safe he made a detour from the route, stopped the car and demanded that I get out. He then proceeded to call the police and told them I was being aggressive and tried to insinuate that I might be armed (I never carry a weapon and even said so while he was talking to 911). The only thing I had said to the driver up to this point is what I described, that I expressed concern about his behavior. Fearful now that this person was trying to involve the police so that they may harm me I decided to leave the car and walk home at 1:30 in the morning. The next day the driver attempted to charge me $150 due to damages to his vehicle. Strangely these damages were on the exterior of the car and also… uh, not visible at all? The customer support has been the opposite of helpful, all I want from them is confirmation that they will not employ unsafe drivers, instead they gave me a $5 voucher that expires in 30 days to an app that I will absolutely never use again.

This is an absolute violation of privacy.

Moreover, the driver could have refused an airport pickup, refused to take the ride if we had luggage. There were no before and after pictures. The driver just filed to Lyft that our ride caused damages and Lyft automatically added these charges to our card. No notice, no investigation.

They tend to be an extra 10-20 minutes late on top of the 10 minute grace period that’s originally set even when I schedule things a day in advance because the app keeps taking them to a street THAT NO LONGER EXISTS but the Lyft Map shows that it still does. Then I have to give them directions to the destination I want to get to and help them out of the area I live in because again the map will take them all the way around town because they don’t recognize existing streets because they previously did not exist there. Lots of maps already exist showing these streets and blocking off the ones that are no longer here but my driver told me that she couldn’t use other ones while working because it won’t pay her… if you’re not gonna allow drivers to use other maps whilst working in Lyft then at least update them please or if you decide not to update them allow usage of other maps because I am not the only one with this issue 😂

Finally, when he arrived in a different car that was pictured on his profile, I asked him if he had stopped for donuts. He did not answer the question and chose to be silent. So, I asked him again.

I end up late. Drivers never speak, they don’t smile. Constantly waiting for the next red light so they can text their buddies back. I’m over it. 

I’m trying to make it to job interviews on time, to get a job, to get a car, to get off of these riding apps. Not only are the prices $25 and up every morning, but you’ll have to order at least an hour in advance to get to a location 5 minutes away.

The driver, let’s call her Helen, had not responded to any of my calls of texts through the app, even when I contacted her just minutes after she dropped me off. She remained unresponsive for the rest of the evening so I put in a request through Lyft. I told them to give her my information and reach out but I cannot confirm that they did so. Even after that, they refused to give me any of Helen’s information. I understand that it would be a security issue but Lyft has said she remains unresponsive to their messages as well. Clearly there is something suspicious going on since it’s been more than 5 days. Lyft also does not have a customer service number and you can only communicate with them via email. It is a frustrating slow process and they also have stopped answering my emails.

4/25/2023 14:03,"I waited 45 minutes for a ride.

After the time updating (it was suppose to be 5 minutes) my first driver called me. During the call he asked here so was going. I told him. Then the next thing I knew my Lyft app had a new driver coming for me. The forts had cancelled after calling me to tell me he was close because he didn’t like where my destination was. The second driver did the same thing but made me wait another 20 minutes. I finally requested a car that cost more because it would be their faster. I paid $5 more for the pickup to be 3 minutes. It took another 12. This driver graciously picked me up and explained they don’t make a lot of money off short drives when it’s busy. Out of $20 drive, he got $4.

6/5/2023 11:42,"When I put in that I’d like a 7:20 AM pickup I don’t expect to be surprised when I come out of the bathroom from doing makeup and find someone is showing up 20 minutes early.

 I am new to Lyft and there may be a way to fix that but when I get my message and that much more time has passed it leaves little or no rides available and of course the price jumps up I am left to take the ride because I don’t have an hour to cancel it obviously. 

I wonder if drivers grab me because I tip well. Do the drivers see that the person up for a ride tips well so they can pick and choose over their fares? My rides almost always are early. Like I am over 20 minutes early for my appointment.

Gives me plenty of times to write. I get great service when they show up. I can’t complain about that at all, but almost every ride is earlier than I want or need. 

I actually tried to put in my pickup time for 7:15 but the time slot wouldn’t go before 7:30. I canceled out of there to just check on cars and they had them in as few as 6 minutes and up.

12/10/2022 21:58,"I scheduled two Lyft rides the day before a Christmas party this year. One ride to take me there, and one to take me home. I was agonizing all week trying to find a service besides Uber that would work for me. Uber wouldn’t let me schedule a ride due to my pickup location, so I turned to Lyft, which seemed to work right away. That was, until they cancelled on me 5 minutes before the scheduled pickup time. Despite this mishap, I was able to find another way to the party. I still had another Lyft that was supposed to take me home, and yet again, this one cancelled on me just a few minutes before I was supposed to be picked up. I was honestly stunned at the incompetence, or maybe it’s just plain malice. Perhaps Lyft is designed to fold at the worst possible time and leave you stranded or missing out on something you were looking forward to all month. At least Uber had the decency to turn me away with time to spare, but it was Lyft that lured me in with a false promise. Ultimately, it was an Uber that got me home that night.

11/6/2023 18:36,"So we all know Uber can get a little expensive at times, but if there’s one thing they have that Lyft doesn’t, it’s consistent charging methods. With Uber, they don’t play with your money. I found out (thankfully just in time) that a payment charge combining feature is on by default, so when you do multiple rides with Lyft in a day, they’ll mush it together into one lump sum. Sounds neat right?

It’s not. It’s the worst feature I’ve ever seen in all my days riding with any taxi or app. You not only get a temporary hold on all those rides you had that day, plus any tips… you ALSO get a temporary hold on the lump sum of all those rides from that same day.

For example, you had two rides that cost you a total of forty bucks, meanwhile you only got a hundred in the bank. No you don’t, you now have twenty bucks in the bank. Good luck for the next 5-7 business days or until payday.

And keep in mind, in the fine print it says they WON’T partial pay with your Lyft Cash if a ride costs more than your Lyft balance. Instead it will seek out your other payment options.

Uber doesn’t play like that. Your Uber cash will help you pay your bill. Is it worth using Uber every time?

7/17/2023 21:52,"My request kept getting cancelled repeatedly today for a long distant ride within a few minutes prior driver’s pick-up arrival from my home in Philadelphia to JFK airport in New York. I heard a few of Lyft driver’s honest thoughts on they operate the platform via driver’s perspective; they tell me that a rider’s destination request doesn’t appear on drivers’ end until it’s accepted or met their customer in-person. Today, after multiple of ride request cancellations, one of the drivers who barely speaks English literally met me and politely denied my request due to his recent surgery treatment in the lower side of his stomach. I understood his struggles with no knowledge of English at all since I don’t speak his language at all as well, which is Spanish. He was kind to me and sincerely guilty for not allowing to drive me to the airport. Consequently, it took over 30 minutes to meet the right driver. I never worked for Lyft nor Uber before, but if this case is true, then I hope Lyft improves this minor flaw by revealing a rider’s destination request to the Lyft drivers to help them decide for the customer’s request in order to avoid further stresses and conflicts to ensure better quality of Lyft service.

She called the police at 9:43pm and the driver cancelled the ride at 9:44pm while they where still in the vehicle. She started attacking him because he was speeding and the way the direction the car was going did not align with the app! He finally stopped the vehicle and unlocked the doors and they got out and ran!!!!! He sat parked for a few minutes then drove off.…. The police where called report has been filed.

I’m not sure what I paid extra for “Preferred” for when this was far worse than Uber X, the lowest fare category of Uber.

11/1/2022 1:33,"I’m not one to get aggravated. But I downloaded this app, paid for a ride- and it automatically “reloaded” my account $50. It took this money out of an account I was in the process of closing since I was moving states. Well I had to close the account, so I asked them for a refund and they were nice about refunding me but before even asking how I wanted it refunded they quickly added it onto my closed account. They told me “their mistake it’ll go back onto my Lyft account in a week or so” and it did. Flash forward- I try this AGAIN. I updated a card on file and removed the other one so this wouldn’t happen again. They refunded it- I never get it. They finally tell me what card they put it on- it’s the closed account. They money never went back on the app. The customer service reps didn’t care, didn’t listen, said it’s up to my bank. What bank? I don’t bank there anymore my account is closed and now my money has just vanished. I respond patiently in the chat and try to get answers and they close the chat and leave, they tell me to wait 20 minutes go by I message again- and they have left the chat.

I was in an unsafe area for 10 minutes longer than I wanted. The app won’t let me access help, the automated system is meant to detect you are wrong about your complaint and deprive you of service — despite any amount of evidence otherwise. Support doesn’t help and wastes your time, on top of being impossible to even find within the app. No email for easier support seeking exists. 

Hope the 10$ was worth it, y’all, I’ve never taken a ride with Uber — and now I will never take another ride with Lyft. Horrible, absolutely terrible customer treatment.

10/6/2022 8:18,"I live in a secured gated apt. Complex out of all the rides I’ve had only one driver actually take the time to do what everyone else does and look my name up in the security box so it will ring my phone. That is the only way I can buzz a car into the complex. I am crippled, on a very fixed income and unfortunately do not have the physical body to walk all the way from back to the front of complex to meet them. Nor do I have extra money to pay for rides I didn’t take ;which is what they do sit at the gate for 3 or 4 min. say “ I didn’t show up “ and I get charged ! I have told Lyft ,given instructions over and over however it constantly happens. Might I say never have they given my money back either.  I have  had worried strangers go to the front and let them in after seeing me in tremendous pain waiting for the drivers but on many occasions I am alone without a way for help. I was told today they can not read our messages?!! This is terrible , taking advantage of handicapped individuals like this. I am a great patron, enjoy the time out but feel this problem should be handled because no other drivers or delivery service seem to not be able to find a name in the security box or does anybody else charge for their error.

So I then added a Lyft Cash to my account on Lyft . you know at their money so I can use a guaranteed ride. So the card that work yesterday wasn’t good today today that card needed to be verified and it needed to be a debit card. I had a previously used a credit card now I need a debit card. I went through so many hoops that I was almost late to work every single time I use the app and ended up having to call a friend because I couldn’t verify that you do that on a card I had already used That’s when I added money to the account. Well, you know what that was even good enough if you add money to the Lyft bank account, you cannot get a refund and we know that now but you also can’t use it unless you have a debit card linked to that as back up well, the reason I add a Lyft Cash is because I don’t have a debit card. I was using a credit card so now they took my money and I couldn’t even use that. It literally took me three weeks to finally get a debit card a card because I had lost my debit card and I could not get a ride anywhere, but they blatantly took no time in taking my money….

1/8/2023 2:30,I’ve already had money taken out yesterday for a ride I requested and it was pending. After work around 5am I noticed I got charged again for the same ride. Then when I tried to find a way to communicate it or find customer service the options available were not helpful at all. I could not speak with anyone to help me solve my issue. I woke up to another notification that the same charge was declined because I locked my card; so they tried to charge me a third time. When I requested a Lyft for work it said I had to choose another method of payment. So I had to forcefully pay for that same ride a third time plus the ride I requested that day. As I get into my office I see that they again tried to charge me a fourth time. I’m really getting frustrated because it just seems like it’s going to keep charging me till I have no money left in my checking account and that is a major problem. On top of that there isn’t a customer service line for me to contact or even an option so I can live chat with someone to help me with my problem. Highly annoyed at the inconvenience because I’m sure I’m going to get charged again for that same ride on top of the ride I’m going to need tomorrow to get to work. Can I get some help please!!!!!!!!

5/4/2023 14:25,"After using the Lift app this week in Chicago for some rides, the standard experience has become choose, wait, get a driver, wait, app stops working the a new driver is selected. Again and again. And again. 

At one location the app was unable to assign a driver for 10 minutes or more and there were no updates, no indication of what the problem was, just an unresponsive app. Closing and restarting it informs it is still working. The last ride to the airport the driver was at the 3 minute mark and went away, new driver again. 

Inquiring with the last driver he said drivers are looking for shorter hops to maximize income. I had long and short hops, same experience. My impression is the drivers are shopping available rides and the app is not up to speed for the shuffle you get trying to catch a ride. I can also report that drivers are increasingly less pleasant and see the company as monetarily less viable, their role minimized. All are sporting both Uber and Lyft and seem to be shopping the rides across both systems. 

This morning the local news said Uber and Lyft drivers were going on strike. To me, both are becoming what I hate about unionized, surly cabbies.

8/16/2023 12:56,"Every time I ask for a Lyft they either come super late. Also if you use online banks they aren’t that compatible with Lyft. Sometimes they wanna work and sometimes they don’t. Even if you use Apple Pay, put your banking information and etc. I’ve had too many issues with this service vs Uber. Uber is usually on the pricier side but you get what you’re paying for. I’ve had multiple rides with Lyft that are supposed to cost around 20-30 max but they end up withdrawing 70-90. You can dispute it and get your money but this is not the customer experience I was looking for. My bank account has more than enough money to cover my rides but it’s the constant hot and cold with this company. They’ve made me late plenty of times and I know I can’t blame the drivers because traffic and etc but when your ride gets canceled 4-7 times that’s just ridiculous. I don’t tip low and I always leave positive reviews on each driver no matter what. If you made it to this point thank you for letting me rant but anyways use this app at your own risk.

7/5/2023 1:53,"I want to love Lyft I really do. They had a better business model than Uber especially when it came to how they treated their employees. But both companies took a huge chunk out of their contractors pay over the part year, I feel like there’s definitely room for a fairer 3rd player. As a ride-share user, tonight was probably the last straw. After being told my ride was “confirmed” I stared at a “waiting for details” screen for over 10 minutes TWICE. When I gave up and ordered an Uber I finally got my details but the Lyft was still 14 minutes away. I cancelled and was charged 4.50. That may not seem like much but what about the time and stress I wasted trying to get a Lyft in the first place? I was out with friends and couldn’t have conversations or anything for a good 30 minutes, on top of them waiting for me, because I was minding my phone wondering when I was gonna have a Lyft. This app needs a big overhaul to give users an accurate ETA. I went from “you will arrive at your destination at 904pm” to “you will arrive at your destination at 925pm” and it STILL didn’t have driver details! That’s why I ordered an Uber instead. I get it, Lyft you don’t have the driver saturation Uber has. But you can’t overpromise ETAs on your app when people have places to be.

We tried many times to get the sunglasses back, due to the way Lyft’s protocols work for contacting drivers we had enormous difficulty getting through to our Lyft driver. After we finally established contact with him, he acknowledged he found the sunglasses in the back of his car and we set up a meeting time with him. However our driver no-showed our arranged drop off. Since communication with drivers while they are on shift is nearly impossible through Lyft, we suggested he drop off the glasses at a police station, at which point the driver immediately ceased communication with us. We escalated this response to Lyft customer service, they were initially helpful and arranged for the driver to ship the glasses back via mail, however this plan also fell through as the driver never the shipped the glasses and Lyft’s customer service ceased all communications on the subject. While losing the glasses was not Lyft’s fault, the Lyft driver ended up stealing them and Lyft customer service refused to take further action, which is a blatant tolerance of driver theft on their platform.

4/24/2023 16:17,"I experienced maybe the worst app and customer experience one could imagine, especially on a service like Lyft.

Left an item in the car. I try to contact the driver. The app has NO options to text or call the driver. Strike 1. 

I go to customer support. They insist there are options to text or call. I reinstall the app, update my OS, send them 20 different screenshots before they’re convinced that they I indeed cannot text or call my driver. Throughout all this they automate messages to me and re ask questions I’ve already answered - I’m convinced I’m speaking to a robot. Terrible support, problem not solved - Strike 2. 

Then they send me to a “specialized team” for support. They say I don’t have options to text or call because I’ve exceeded the “self service limit” - I ask what that is, they say it’s “something internal on our side that you don’t need to worry about.” Lack of transparency on what this limit is (website does not mention it) + still inability to call the driver with my lost item = Strike 3.

Their solution: text the driver my contact info and hope he calls me. Guess what? He has not contacted me. Lyft’s efforts to protect its drivers and idiotic app experience has led to a thoroughly poor user experience.

11/22/2021 23:34,"i took a lyft after a 2 week hiatus and now remember why i stopped using them. first off, their touting algorithm has no concept of two way streets and often sends a driver to arrive on the wrong side of the street or drop off on the wrong side of the street. you have 2 options in this case - cross the street unsafely or walk to the nearest crosswalk and then back to your destination. would dropping someone off a block away be acceptable if it is safe and legal to be closer? of course not, but this is what wrong side arrivals and drop offs force. 

next, conveniently every wait time is less than 5 minutes since this is the cutoff for cancelling without penalty. coincidence?  i don't think so.

absolutely not. in fact, it just got worse after getting lyft pink and i wish i was exaggerating. the service/app just got more and more disappointing. i was being left stranded way more often. my wait times got incredibly longer for rides. it has been too many times that lyft will double the told wait time then cancel the order which is extremely inconvenient considering i use lyft to get to and from work.

over the last couple weeks i was issued three warnings that i was not wearing a mask or using it improperly which i can definitively say has not been the case. i always wear a proper surgical mask over my nose and mouth and do not take it off at any time during the ride. my account ended up being suspended because of these three warnings over the two weeks and i tried multiple times to reach out to dispute this claim. they basically said there's nothing that they can do about it and i just had to wait until my suspension was over.

 i find this absolutely ridiculous. if there's a system that is in place to penalize riders for not wearing a mask, there needs to also be a way for us to dispute warnings that are not accurate. i appreciate the company taking covid and mask mandates seriously but i have found this situation extremely frustrating. will be taking uber.",1,FALSE,False mask accusations and no way to dispute,JYJW0113,,,,,,,,,23.19489762

the issue i encounter with lyft (uber too sometimes) is it takes ages to find a driver if you lucky. it takes a good 15+ minutes of searching before exiting out each time. how is there no drivers in a big city? i can kinda understand during a holiday or maybe a weekend/night but not middle of the day. at that point i have to switch ride sharing apps for it to work. 

what i can see as a solution to fix this issue is to have a timer for 2 minutes or so and if no one accepts it within that time, the app will automatically accept it for the closest driver and they can't decline it without paying a $10 fee. if the driver does those $10 fee twice in a year then they will be terminated. doing this will help balance the system and make it a smoother process for both the driver and passengers.",2,FALSE,Long wait times,my Mustang,,,,,,,,,14.71362522

here is my personal experience of what happened:
i scheduled a ride, received a confirmation from lyft shortly afterwards that my ride had been scheduled (for the next morning). about 30 minutes before my scheduled ride i got a notification from lyft saying that they would start looking for drivers. then i got a notification that my ride was confirmed by a driver and that i'd be notified when they were on their way.

they never came, and when it was past the window of when they were scheduled to come, lyft started looking for a new driver and couldn't find one.

i had a driver pick me up from my work, drive a couple miles, say his app isn't working and i'm driving him for free, and asked me to cancel and re order. the next driver i cancelled as he was trying to pick me up again. he drove me to a random corner and said it's a good spot and kicked me out.

good luck calling corporate (if there even really is one). i spoke to some nice young man from india who told me there's nothing he can do, because he was in the accident reporting department (only one i could get a call back from).

12/29/2021 20:13,well it's been a roller coaster riding with lyft because i just started using lyft a week ago and the first day i used it was the worst experience you could have i guess i shouldn't have let ivonne the driver invite someone else to drive me to atlantic city because he was a very unsafe driver and he speeded and drove recklessly at times and then as we arrived in atlantic city the mood changed very quickly because ivonne wanted a off the books ride so we came to an agreement on $100 cash and then the driver who she said was her boss so i guess because he was the one that actually drove he wanted the $170 that was the price that was close to what the ride would've been which didn't make sense to me because it's not like lyft doesn't take there share of the ride so we got into an argument and i didn't know where we were so as we drove down harrahs blvd he decided to stop the car and jump into the back where he decided to start hitting me in my leg and thigh and then started punching me and i was trying to calm him down and i said whatever i will just give you the money and then he said then give it to me then he grabbed my cell phone and threw it into the bushes area and i was going to get the phone but then i saw him jump into the car so i didn't want him to take off with all my belongings so i was able to pop the trunk and grab my duffel bag but i wasn't able to grab my suitcase which had most of my clothes thousands of dollars worth of clothes i had cash and jewelry and other personal belongings that i really need but he just took off and wouldn't even answer the phone and ivonne acted like none of this ever happened so i was assaulted and then grand theft of my suitcase so it started off as a nightmare but since then the drivers have been great and they are just what i expected them to be!!! but i'm stilll upset that even lyft hasn't really got back to me on this issue so it looks like they aren't even investigating so i'm just very disappointed in how they are handling this or shall i say not really doing anything and are not even handling this!!,5,FALSE,Lyft experience,Chiapomluva38,,,,,,,,,22.41705264

4/15/2022 1:02,"i have generally had excellent riding experiences with the app. in nyc the app generally offers a variety of rates based on wait times for a ride and type of vehicle. tonight i could have selected a general rate of around $18 to my destination, but with wait time for pickup estimated at 17 minutes. then for around $4 more i was offered a pick-up in just 1 minute, if i selected that option immediately, which i did. after i selected i was told my estimated time for pick up was 15 minutes. so i figured the car available in only a minute had been taken. several seconds later the app found a car that was estimated to pick me up in 7 minutes.  that car did arrive within the estimated time, but to my surprise after i got home i discovered that i had been charged the higher rate. the $4 difference will not break me, but these types of rate and wait time discrepancies seem to occur all too frequently. although traffic can always be a factor in longer wait times in new york city, traffic does not seem to be an issue whenever i encounter these discrepancies. i have also been charged with cancellation fees at least twice when a driver failed to show up at the designated place, and did not offer me the courtesy of a phone call. i hope that lyft will endeavor to improve its app and other systems to benefit the customer. frankly, i have been using good old nyc taxi cabs more often over the past year or longer, because of taxis' superior availability, reliability, and predictability. maybe nyc taxis will now drive their chief competitors, uber and lyft, to improve delivery of customer service in this competitive market place. we will see.",4,FALSE,App car fare charges,Cliff NYC-UES,,,,,,,,,18.99122379

6/9/2022 2:14,"this app seems to have way more bugs (yes, specifically app bugs) than uber. i have good comparison since i'm a heavy user of both. it also doesn't have any obvious place in the ui for users to report bugs. i wonder if those two facts are related. one example from today is when i were waiting for a shared saver ride, got an app notification that the driver is arriving soon, and one minute later the entire ride has disappeared - no notification about the driver canceling, not a trace in ride history, nothing. i was back on the ""where are you going?"" screen. another bug from an app version months ago that lasted for many days was with multi-stop rides. the driver would only see the final stop of the ride - we actually compared how the app was showing the ride differently on our devices and were amazed! the bug lasted for several days and maybe longer, but i switched entirely to uber for multi-stop rides.  sometimes the app has inaccurate map data as well (i have witnessed a railway station to have pickup spot located on a nearby freeway, where it's even illegal for a pedestrian to be). there is no way either to report this kind of problems as well. all the app's issue reporting features are dedicated to problems with the drivers. when i contacted user support, the representatives seemed unable to grasp the concept of a bug report or to acknowledge there might be a problem within the app itself and its underlying network services. i think that until the developer rethinks this design or improves their testing, lyft app will continue to suffer from those common and preventable issues.",2,FALSE,"App buggy, doesn't provide an avenue for reporting app bugs",The_Olo,,,,,,,,,17.21541734

5/18/2022 0:45,"lyft as well as their competitor, uber use many algorithms to give the riders a perception of high demand which involves sending ride requests to cars farther away than other cars. they then charge the passenger higher rates because it's busy. the company keeps almost all if not all of the extra fare charged to the passenger in most cases. the passengers feel they are paying enough just for the ride so they do not tip the driver, and tips are a huge part of the drivers income. when driver income goes down while their costs go up, such as massive inflation on fuel and everything else associated with car maintenance, drivers drive less or quit completely thus fulfilling the perceived appearance of it being busy only now it is busy because there aren't enough drivers to accommodate the demand. the pay to drivers is less now than when i started driving for both companies in 2015. i make less money for doing the same ride while it costs me more just to do the ride. their driver turnover has always been massive for many reasons, not only financial but also because of dealing with the entitled passengers who think it's perfectly acceptable to be rude and disrespectful, vomit in a strangers car and pretend nothing happened and many other horrible behaviors. most passengers start off badly by rudely attempting to help themselves into a strangers car without first verifying to the driver that they are the person they are looking for. a rider has zero reason to ever get into the wrong car because they have all the info on their phone including the license plate of the car. there is not another car on the planet with that plate. find that car and let the driver know you are his/her passenger. easy peasy. stop playing the who are you picking up? game with a driver that only wants to know they are picking up the correct person. a person who is trying to scam a free ride will do exactly that and whatever name the driver says, they magically become that person. the driver has no way to verify otherwise. the apps will send the driver to the wrong address and they have basically zero info about the passenger because people make fake profiles, no pics with fake names such as karzilla, rumplestiltskin, scorpio five star and my favorite, . i have met all these people and many more.

8/16/2022 3:55,"i once thought that uber was the best &
lyft was a mediocre knock-off- boy was i
wrong! i have had such trouble with uber-
problems with rude drivers who actually
left on me while i was in bank during a round trip & i am in a wheelchair!/ problems with
being over-charged/ problems with being double charged! ...& i have been so very
frustrated bcuz there is never a way to contact uber. they say they are there online with a real time chat for support, yet when
i did that the chat 'person' told me ""no
problem at all! we can issue you a credit!""
& i was then led to a page online which
was making me pay $ to get my credit-
did you ever hear of such ridiculous nonsense & immorality!! 
the icing on the cake was when i had a 9.99$
charge on my debit card which i knew i did
not make & it was literally from uber to join
their membership- can you imagine?! to actually think you can take a clients $
without their knowledge or approval!
so, of course i stopped my debit card,
deleted my uber app & immediately got
the lyft app.
i could not be happier!!! every lyft driver has
been above & beyond! 
& if you change a destination or cancel a trip
lyft immediately contacts me asking if i have
any problem or trouble!
& lyft gives me the choice to wait a bit longer for a less expensive ride!
lyft rocks! with lyft i actually feel like they
care!
like i am dealing with humans!
like i am a person & not just a $ sign! 
like i have nothing to worry about!
...just the other night my lyft driver was running late in wpb because of detours
downtown & the driver called me &
called again- the person standing next to
me - a policeman said have faith! i had
commented (bcuz of my jaded experience 
w uber) that would probably no- show...
but waiting together we joked about it
& lo & behold- up the one way street i
was on comes my lyft! 
& the driver was so apologetic!
& so kind!
& without me even mentioning uber- she
commented to me...""i once drove for uber
but, i was just a robot driver- they don't care
about their drivers- only about $ ! & they pay
less & i am now so much more comfortable 
driving...""
well, that says it all!
that is the reason behind the excellent service i have received from lyft- it starts
from the top- if you care about your drivers
& treat people well it trickles down & all
are happy!
riding with lyft is a win-win ride!
...& that's something very very important 
especially in the world we live in today.
lyft is a breath of fresh air!
...a welcome indication that all is not lost
in the world we live in!
...there are still thank god, companies like
lyft with moral integrity & the proof is in
every safe & happy ride you take!
thank you lyft!",5,FALSE,lyft over uber,redeemed riderÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¤ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¸ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¸ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¸ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ,,,,,,,,,15.0196064

7/1/2022 15:49,"lyft used to be a great alternative to getting around los angeles on time. however, it's now just a waste of time even trying to use it to schedule your time. the rides never show up within the allotted window because the app continually changes the driver. yesterday, i waited an hour and a half while drivers would almost reach my pick up point and the app would select a different driver. this happened 8 times causing me to be late to work. this happens every time i schedule a ride. if i don't schedule, the standard ride which is the least expensive always shows limited availability, yet the more expensive lux and higher are always available. you gotta be kidding me? just fyi, the taxis in los angeles are now cheaper than lyft, usually by about $10 per ride and they can be scheduled ahead through the ride yellow app. and they are on time. don't bother with lyft and their inefficient scam anymore. they're just a money grab with no respect for their customers' time.

update: here we go again. i stopped using lyft for a while and this morning decided to give it another go. scheduled a ride for 8:30 am and was notified at 8:20 my driver was 14 minutes away. reasonably inside the service window. then at 8:30 when my driver was 5 minutes away, the starts playing musical driver. now 18 minutes away, 12 minutes away, 21 minutes away, 7 minutes away, 15 minutes away. it's now 8:50 and i'm finally in the car i scheduled for 20 minutes ago two hours ahead of time. lyft is the worst. i'm deleting this app again and won't be adding it back this time.",1,FALSE,Don't bother scheduling,Joeyarty,,,,,,,,,16.48748275

2/11/2022 5:22,i received an email about a driver that decided to cancel on me. when he showed up he barely stopped then just sped away. i am going to say it was most likely because i had my 1 year old son and 2 teenage daughters with me. or because it was about a 45 min drive. what bothers me about it is that the email i received said i wasn't wearing my mask properly. i take offense to this because i work a professional job where i need to wear a mask up to 16 hours in a day sometimes and this guy never even address me or bothered to stop. it is not fair that he chose he didn't want to take me and my kids then go on and lie about the situation. the weather is cold outside. i really wish i could've got his information to report him because it wasn't right and i really don't appreciate it and i won't be using lyft anymore. the driver who replaced him was very nice but i didn't see the email until after i got to my destination. if i would've seen it before i wouldn't have used lyft. when i reached out to lyft by email because i couldn't find a number anywhere to call they basically told me they were going to remove what he reported on my account but that i should be aware of the policies in other words saying he was right and i was wrong. i've worked in customer service for over 20 years and that is the first time i have seen without hesitation even after explaining the situation they automatically assumed what the driver said was right. i wasn't getting a free ride and i was with my kids in the cold and got left behind not ok at all!,1,FALSE,I got left behind with my kids in the cold!,sheiirbt,,,,,,,,,21.01765748

1/31/2022 18:06,"the title is fairly self explanatory but basically i was in an uber from the airport at roughly 1-2 in the morning, to go and pick up packages that contained $1,000 worth of holiday presents for my sister. there was to be two stops, one to pick up the packages and the other to my apartment. after picking up the packages my sister called me and said to come to my parents house instead, and so i changed my location in the app, the change was accepted, i saw it on the app, however he said he wouldn't drive me to the new destination because in his words he wouldn't make any money from the ride he told me i had to cancel my ride at two in the morning, hastily handed me my bags from the airport (not handing me my packages) slammed the trunk and drove off before i could realize i didn't have my packages. it was 2 am and i had gotten off a plane, as soon as i realized i reached out to the driver and to lyft as many times as i could, the driver never responded to any of my requests/reward offerings, and lyft has offered the most unhelpful horrible customer service, because they've offered me nothing. not even driver information to make a police report for grand larceny. they claim they're not allowed. i am very curious what they would do if i claimed i had been the target of discrimination, or sexual harassment, or if i had a viral video on instagram or tiktok that people were sharing. basically lyft will only help their customers if their backs are pressed against the wall, and i wouldn't recommend this app to my worst enemy. i'm not ubers biggest fan but i'll never drive lyft again after they've allowed me to be robbed to the tune of $1,000 dollars",1,FALSE,"Driver stole $1,000 from me after kicking me out of his car.",Shane123455,,,,,,,,,21.35538149

i have had several very horrific lyft trips with ignorant and rude drivers that's why i don't really use your service. especially since none of those drivers were ever reprimanded due to their ignorance, negligence. some were under the influence of an illegal narcotic. how do i know this. the marijuana smell was so strong once we sat inside. since we had to get home due to having to call 3 times because of the first 2 drivers ignorant and unprofessional behavior and vulgar language and as i stated one was under the influence and the marijuana smell was so strong we could smell it even thought we were several feet from his vehicle. and over this past year and a half your prices have become discouraging, ridiculous and outrageous. you can even call the fares criminal during the past few months. uber is even worse. taking advantage of american consumers when many of us have been inflicted harshly from the spread of covid-19 and the financial devastation we have experience from the negative and harmful impact it has caused our economy. i truly hope your upper management, administration offices and ceo thoroughly read and understand this comment. and make these next two request of the highest priority. please, severely improve your fares, passenger safety and satisfaction and improve your guidelines of your drivers making customer safety and professional treatment number 1. you many contact me.",1,FALSE,Driver's,Philly is fun,,,,,,,,,22.63705712

1/25/2022 6:19,"on new year's 2022, wife and i took a ride back from dinner at a steakhouse in vegas. it was a 11 minute ride but a 3 weeks ordeal to resolve a driver's claim that we damaged his car with paint and some other old stain underneath the mat behind the passenger side where i was sitting. i was shock to see a damage charge of $80 on my card. i immediately tried to find ways to get in touch with lyft customer service. only way is by chat. but to get to chat, one would need to answer few questions. the option for me was to resolve a damage charge but this does not lead to customer service. it just leads to a explanation why there was a charge. so i had to choose other random choices before being able to chat with an agent. first agent told to wait a minute, but ended up to more about 10 mins, that he will be back to assist. i understand if their are other customers in front of me but let me know. anyways, after i told the agent what happened, i was told that they can not help me and that it was my fault because the driver sent them the picture after my ride. i told them that how can i prove something we did not do. it was frustrating that they didn't believe me. they sent me an image of what the driver sent. the damage looked like an old stain and also it has yellow and red paint like stain. the ride was from 9:33 pm to 9:45 pm. who carried paint with them to a nice steakhouse?! if the lyft customer service agent reviewed the image more carefully, he would realize the stain is underneath the floor mat because the mat was moved to the side. i told him if i can speak to his manager, but he insisted that the manager agreed with the decision that we caused the damage. few days later, after not being to think about anything else but this fraud, i chatted with another agent. i told him what had happened and he agreed that this damage could not have been caused by us. the damage fee charge will be credited back in account. unfortunately, it was not and i forgot about it until today. i spoke to a third agent, told him what happened and he had to do more research and stated that the credit was not processed and he apologized for the inconvenience. but so far i noticed an immediate ride refund but not the $80 damage charge fee. i quickly got back to the chat and he said it will be in 3-5 days. i've heard this before. let's see if this happens. but the way the lyft agents communicate really is upsetting. the way they respond and the lack of carefully reading the questions and comments i made me feel like they just wanted to move on as quickly as they can because there is not way to hold these agents accountable for their poor understanding of the customers' situation. i can not trust lyft drivers and especially lyft employees and will be doing business with them.",1,FALSE,Untrustworthy Driver and Horrible Lyft Customer Service Employees,pengdennis,,,,,,,,,21.56476769

12/6/2021 21:39,"1. i had a scheduled ride for 2:55-3:05pm pickup. a driver arrived at 2:45pm. i texted him that i could get to the pickup spot in 2 minutes (even though he was super early). he immediately wrote me as a no-show, despite him being super early. this canceled my scheduled ride! why didn't they match me with a new driver? the reason i schedule the ride ahead of time is i am in a time crunch and don't have time at 2:50 to be inputting addresses. yet that is what i had to do because the driver canceled before the pickup time and the lyft system decided i didn't need a ride after all. i tried to contact lyft support but i am only allowed to complain if i got charged money or if i am currently in a ride. i resent that my paying for lyft pink covers for that driver being terrible and for the system not getting me a new ride at all. 

2. why am i not allowed to have pronouns? i have gone to that part of the app to add my pronouns and all it does is explain what pronouns are and to add them if i want but the rest is blank! my husband is able to add his pronouns on his account t but i can't. i went to the account section of the help area and it only answers questions about profile name and picture. 

also, the app will tell me only a minute or two before pickup that my driver will be on the other side of the street. not helpful because i am not planning to jay walk and walking down the street to cross and then back down the street to the pickup location (which it no longer is since it's the wrong side of the street) will take longer than the driver doing a u-turn, so thanks for that inconvenience.

2/14/2022 15:43,"i live in a capitol city on the us, but it is small. i have learned that i can't request a ride the same day i need it because there aren't necessarily enough drivers on any given day. (i missed a job interview for this reason, but thankfully my now employer was understanding.) i schedule rides in advance, which can cost up to double what i would be charged if i requested a ride about an hour before i want one. i tell myself that it's alright to pay a premium when i am ordering a human to arrive at my location right when i want. but the app doesn't actually do that. drivers often arrive 15+ minutes before the arrival window and i end up leaving in a panic. (riders must be ready within a certain time window after the driver arrives. failure to do so can result in not only a missed ride but consequences on one's account as well.) 

in this city, the lyft model is not working. i'm sure these issues don't come up in larger cities, but certainly if the company/decision makers wanted to, they could do better. it's a very poor reflection on what is advertised as a service that provides rides on demand. 

i would prefer to contact customer service, but i couldn't find a way to provide policy feedback other than this. 

at the very least, lyft could make these possibilities more clear to riders. i've had the system explained by multiple drivers, otherwise i would have a hard time piecing together the issue. 

unfortunately our mass transit system isn't robust. but at least city buses are required to stay at their scheduled stops if they happen to arrive 10 minutes early.",2,FALSE,Unfair fare,ElyseGambino,,,,,,,,,20.906972

11/20/2021 23:25,"if/when there's an issue getting a driver for a scheduled ride, lyft doesn't offer customer service. no hotline, chat, nothing.
it costs about $5-10 more for a lyft scheduled in advanceeven when it arrives 40 min late. and it turns out lyft doesn't actually arrange the pre-scheduled ride more than 10 min in advance. that might be fine if you happen to live in an area with plenty of drivers, but i don't.
by the time lyft found me a driver for my ride to work earlier today, the app said the driver was 25 min away. if that had been accurate and there was no local traffic, i would've only just gotten there on time.
it was not accurate. the app eventually found me a closer driver, but they were having connectivity issues; the car froze on the map 2 or 3 min away. i was assigned a third driver, who did show up eventuallywithout a mask over his nose. (i've had other drivers who just wear face shields, which are significantly less effective than masks.) i would've canceled the ride and started a new one, but there would've been even less of a guarantee for that to pan out.
so i was 30 min late for a job where i'm new enough to still be in a probationary periodand charged by lyft what i had agreed to pay if the ride had been on time. no word from my supervisors yet on whether i'm in trouble.
previously, i'd scheduled another ride to work, and the driver justnever showed. not even a notification that they'd found me a driver, but at least i had enough time to cancel and get a new one (who happened to be nearby just out of luck).
i kept using lyft occasionally to get to work because public transit will take an additional 50 minutes. but it'll be worth it to be on time for my job, assuming i haven't already been fired.",2,FALSE,"Unreliable scheduling, no customer service",57bells,,,,,,,,,23.67081608

i had 1 ride very late at night & driver was angry or annoyed at having a late night rider. he drove like a maniac with his stereo literally at full volume & threw me around back seat because he didn't wait for me to get seatbelt on. it's difficult to report those things with their complaint/report issues set up isn't provided and no customer service number. note: that never happened before or after that. drivers are typically very kind.
today i was charged $9.99 & again charged but that time it was $12.99 & i can't report it or get ahold of anyone. i loathe thieves! i'm an excellent tipper & always personable kind & pleasant.  if i'm running into a quick mart on round trip ride, i always tell the driver if they need anything to please come in with me and do their little shopping and tell them i'd be happy to wait until they're done getting coffee or lunch or anything else.

if lyft would have it set up with some basic questions to choose from along with a section to write what you need help with or what you need to report, maybe people wouldn't get so frustrated. i know for a fact that many customers feel exactly like i do.

- the payment method details are entered incorrectly

not likely as it has almost a $0 balance and accepted by bar and back at hotel it was accepted by amazon

2/4/2022 22:06,"i think the entire idea of lyft is absolutely brilliant! being able to request a ride at the drop of a dime is so convenient, and has come in clutch for myself more times than i can count! the only thing i can say that i don't agree with is the way you all put a hold on my money for rides that i never had. for example last night (the roads here are icy so there wasn't alot of drivers out) i tried to get my daughter a lyft. i tried a few different times (with no prevail) but was unable to get one. but lyft still put a hold on my card for the 25$. also.... her boyfriend tried himself after it didn't work for me after several attempts, and he was able to schedule one with no problems and they picked my daughter up in like 10 mins. so i didn't understand why mine wouldn't work? my only other suggestion would be that the drivers ask their riders what they want to listen to on the radio... because sometimes the drivers are listening to certain podcast and channels that can be offensive to their riders, so maybe just ask because it can make the ride awkward.but for the most part i do appreciate lyft and all the convenience of it!",4,FALSE,More like suggestions,Malihihah502,,,,,,,,,21.22097289

so i had decided to purchase a $60 gift card for lyft, i hadn't used it in a while, and it was a treat to myself (amazon egift card from my boss, and used some on the lyft gift card. i applied it to my account, and all seemed to be okay.

up until the same error messages kept coming up, saying, sorry, there was a payment issue with your payment info, and it wanted me to add a new card with the same billing address as the card that is on file has.

not only have i attempted to do this process, but there are only 3 cards that i and have added to my account and for some reason, lyft's terrible and awful application seems to think that i entered my address in correctly. i've lived in nyc for 10 years, i'm pretty sure if uber isn't having these issues, then you should either, and something likes this need to be brought up and addressed immediately. 

customer service is an absolute joke. especially when my account is locked and it seems that i have a lingering $60 gift card balance, that i can't even use because of these errors.
