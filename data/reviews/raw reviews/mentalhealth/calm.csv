It’s as if they have beautifully sculpted the app with time. I really appreciate the choices given when I open Calm. Sometimes I need a moving meditation. Sometimes I need the wisdom Sometimes a little humor and sometimes only Tamara’s calming voice will do. I really appreciate the meditating sounds of soft rain or a washing machine or waves ebbing & flowing. But my very tough Working K9 will only calm when going through his annual vet visit with blood tests and shots and such to Baby Shhh and it works every time. So I guess if Calms me and my dog, I have to give it five stars. I love the breathing part. I use it almost daily. Not a fan of the music but the sleep stories are the best and I love that I can use the search bar and find one of my favorites I may be in the mood for such as a dream over Paris or the history of the Library at Oxford or the train stories. Also the narrators offer excellent choices and their are certain ones whom I just need to hear at hard times because their soft melodic gift of storytelling puts me right out. I really appreciate the variety. I have had the Calm app I believe since not long after it launched and as others have come and gone and Calm has had its own growing pains, it’s the one with which I remain. So, thanks Calm, from my Tough Dog and I both.",5,True,you crossed the line,Has become better with years

I stumbled upon a television commercial about it a few years ago and decided to give it a try.  I have had trouble falling asleep for years, and was honestly skeptical that an app would put me to sleep. Boy was I wrong!  I love the different options - sleep stories, music, meditation - each one is interesting, and while I can’t say I’ve managed to get to end of a story…well that’s the point.  I’m out within five minutes.  I’ve read some reviews about the expense - here’s the thing - what is your sleep and a relaxed mindset worth to you?  Divide that annual cost by 365 and you’re paying a pittance for your health.  Check back around the holidays - the makers of Calm run specials sometimes that make it even more worthwhile.  I had just renewed my annual fee two summers ago, when an end of year special came around.  It was a lifetime subscription that was going to save hundreds of dollars over the years. I knew I wouldn’t get the remainder of my annual fee (8 months left) refunded if I jumped on the lifetime subscription, but it was still worth the jump.  This is a must have app.

I thought I knew everything about diaphragmatic breathing, as it has been drilled into my head over the years. A couple weeks ago, my heart rate shot up. For the first time in my life, I was confident it wasn’t a panic attack and actually a heart attack. I stumbled out my apartment door, sweat dripping down my face and the few clothes covering my body. I dropped my phone on the way down the stairs but happened to call 911 right beforehand. Medics arrived. After about 10 minutes, they knew and I knew it was panic. I went back upstairs and started searching for every app I could think of. I found calm. I tried the first 7 days and was hooked. Some may think… well I don’t have panic or OCD. It’s not for me. It’s so much more than that. I listened to a series by Lebron James that was amazing. There are different breathing techniques and meditations for sleep, work, anxiety, movement… etc…

I know I’ve said a lot and probably more than anyone needs. If I would have had the Calm app a few weeks ago during the worst panic attack of my life, I probably wouldn’t have had to call 911. At least try the trial. It’s very much worth it.",5,False,dg5753,Why did I get the subscription?

Some of them, however, are just a bit...jarring. I know everyone has different tastes but I like to listen to voices directing me during meditation or towards sleep that don’t jump out at me. Please, Calm, add more voices like Eduardo Ballerini, Ramon Tikaram, Chiké Okonkwo, May Charters and Jerome Flynn. Cillian Murphy is a great guest sleep story teller but please don’t just use celebrities because of name value. They don’t all make good storytellers/meditation guides. Some write the stories and I am grateful to those who come up with such wonderful sleep stories for adults. The ones that travel back in time, especially aboard old trains are outstanding! Just curate the voices a little better because some of us are too sensitive to the nuances of voice to listen to many of the meditations/stories. That’s kind of a waste. I end up listening to the same ones over and over. Please make the sleep stories at least 35 minutes, too. For those of us who need longer to drift away.

However calm allows me to find hope in my current predicaments, and is amazing at calming me down. I really enjoy the soundscapes and meditation but my favorite thing is definitely the sleep story’s.
Listening to a bedtime story made for little kids mostly is really strangely therapeutic. There are more adult options but give the kiddy one’s a try. I feel like I’m one of the last demographics that these sleep story’s would reach but they make me feel more secure and able to connect back to the security of childhood. 
But anyways I highly recommend this app, the subscription is a bit pricey but the quality isn’t matched anywhere else. Falling asleep, calming down, feeling secure, and gaining more confidence & hope have all been easy and peaceful to do with this app. I’ve been falling asleep with my headphones on every night so I can listen to this without disturbing my roommate.

However because of the issues described in the title I probably will no longer subscribe to calm next year. I am blind, and use the screen reader voiceover. I can play the videos for the content well enough with play pause, fastforward but the biggest barrier I am facing is that the mountains which you tap on in the for you tab  to bring up the settings are unlabeled. I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible.

I look for sound meditation with chimes at various times depending on how long I would like to meditate. And if I want a guided meditation, I want to be able to search by length, not topic. But all that being said, the sleep story side of this app is 5 stars. It has saved me from sleepless nights and eased me back to sleep when I’ve woken in the night due to anxiety and illness. While I don’t use it every night, when I do, I am asleep within minutes. On nights when I’m having a hard time sleeping, one to two will ease me to sleep.

It is so worth it to pay for the subscription, and even before I paid for the subscription (my doctor recommended the app to me not knowing I had the free version of it for about 3 years already) there was a lot of content available. I love the calendar features as well, and the check-ins are a great way for me to reflect on my day and practice gratitude. 

One suggestion I have though are podcasts! I like to listen to people talking about any subject while I’m doing tasks around the house or just trying to sleep (sometimes the silence is a lot and I can’t focus on sleeping with my thoughts).

2022-01-19 13:38:10,,Ok so to start off I like it but I can barely even use anything. I was trying to do the 7 day sleep meditation but I can only do the first day and I had to repeat the first day over and over and over. All because I didn’t have the premium and the premium is $70 a year. I didn’t want to get it because that would waste my money but everything is locked for premium. So here is what I am thinking that you should do I think you should make it 50/50. Like 50% of the stuff that is locked for the premium and make it not premium so it can be fair to those who don’t have the premium and to those who have it. Now let’s talk about the price we should make it reasonable enough to get and instead of $70 let’s make it 35 dollars so it can be fair and people would be happy if they had the premium or not because they get a reasonable price and they get to use many of the meditations if they have it and if they don’t. Sorry if this was confusing but I want it to be fair because the price and the amount of meditations that you can use without the premium wasn’t fair so I wanted to make it reasonable and fair. So now I want to hear what you have to say because there are many other people that might agree with me but I am wondering if you do too,3,False,mikethehousekey123,I like it but……….
2022-11-14 19:29:25,,"This app is a must-have for everybody. Firstly, I love the student discount they offer. The regular subscription is a bit pricy for me currently as a college student but the student discount makes helpful mindfulness tools accessible to stressed college students. The app contains incredibly helpful grounding techniques, guided meditations, and breathing exercises. With anxiety especially, sometimes the physical symptoms can worsen the psychological symptoms. It’s very beneficial to be able to focus your attention on how you’re presently feeling, how slowly you’re breathing to help calm yourself down. I really love using the check-in tools in the mornings and before bed, to track how I’ve been feeling over a span of time. It makes it easier to tell my psychiatrist and therapist how I’ve been feeling and for how long. I also love the sleep stories and soundscape features to help me sleep. Sometimes with my anxiety, laying in bed in silence with my thoughts keeps me awake for hours after getting ready for sleep.

2022-10-11 11:25:11,,I want to say I tried this app back in 2015 or 2016. I took a break from it for a while after I found Insight Timer because I much preferred the content on that app (comes from thousands of creators and is free). I REALLY do not enjoy Tamara’s voice and refuse to listen to it which eliminates about 30% of the content on this app (previously her voice accounted for 90% so this is an improvement). This is what originally led me to explore other apps. They’re really beginning to expand on variety now and I don’t have to listen to that god-awful Mid-Atlantic-like accent while I’m trying to meditate or go to sleep. I love the sleep stories and my boyfriend has also grown to look forward to picking one out. One thing I noticed recently that I would like to call out to the developers was that I had turned on Jay Shetty’s sleep meditation and noticed I was able to still listen to my background music of choice from the home page. This was really really cool and something I hope I’m able to do to customize the background sounds for my other meditations. If it’s a new feature or something please continue to offer it!

There is a free app trial but you do have to pay after the trial ends but I think in my opinion it’s worth buying the app! My one recommendation though is that I think the calm app should add some more journaling to the app something more than the check ins because I think journaling is a great way to help you feel your releasing your past or just writing how happy you are if that makes sense plus if it’s not to much maybe add something to remind you to get off your phone and go outside or do some focusing hour on school work or something like that.

I find Tamara’s voice very soothing—not annoying, and the soundscapes in the background are perfect.  It would be nice if there was a setting or a collection of audios for those who work nights and therefore sleep in the day time. It can be hard to sleep with all the noises of day (lawn mowers, car horns, noisy neighbors,etc.) It would also be nice if the daily check ins could take this into consideration as well—when I meditate in the morning after I get off work, the question is “how did you sleep last night?” Well I worked last night so that doesn’t apply. 

As far as the $70/year, this is affordable for me but I realize that isn’t the case for everyone—especially in this economy.

2021-08-16 15:11:56,,"Two major concerns. First of all, I judge how sincere an app like this is about helping people by the availability of free content. I understand that it takes resources to produce content of this quality, but this app verges on hostile towards the non-paying user, and some people just can’t afford to pay. I saw someone saying that the master classes were available, so I looked into that - um, no. It’s the *trailers* that are available, and this sort of bait-and-switch is typical of the non-paying experience in this app.

Second, I have chronic pain, and there isn’t any content that comes up when I search for that - there apparently isn’t anything health-related at all. The one free guided meditation I found started triggering panic as it made me more aware of my pain, and I had to stop. 

The upshot is that this app seems targeted towards a “beautiful person” demographic whose problems really will all go away if they start meditating. The series by Lama Rod Owens seems like a step in the right direction, but it’s going to take a complete reevaluation of the goals and design to really address the problem. Right now, if you’re disabled, broke, aging ungracefully, traumatized, or whatever, this app will constantly remind you that you don’t belong in the “Calm” space.",1,False,Rissahoo,"I really wanted to love this, but"

There is such a refreshing trend of prioritizing mental health in this age. But that’s half of the battle to actually helping people. I’m sure this app has good intentions but there will be no change in the epidemic of mental health issues so long as help is unattainable for ALL people who need it, not just those that can pay. If I had the means, I’d pay for a therapist. But those who lack the means to meet with someone are also left behind in such an accessible app that has such capability to make a difference. So my review: I feel very hungry for the help that this app offers and I feel truly left behind.

Generalized anxiety disorder is an excessive form of anxiety and can be followed by uncountable physical symptoms like muscle tension, restlessness being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, etc. This app is a great way to reduce anxiety because the mediation that occurs throughout the seven days helped me feel more relaxed and I did not have as much tension as I normally do.",5,False,App review psy 250,App Review Braxton.A

I am so incredibly grateful for it because I’ve been using it for the past two months and it took me out a depressive episode. 

Jeff Warren’s content keeps me around. It’s because of his 30 day course that I’ve finally established a meditation practice after years of sincere attempts. His approach is very human and relatable; I find sessions with his recordings much more fruitful since he sandwiches the nuggets of clarity between quiet moments. I’m able to ease into the session, instead of being urged into quietness then being lectured by Tamara..maybe that works for other people but it’s inaccessible to me. 

I also use the children’s meditations with my five year old daughter and the sleep stories when she’s having a hard time sleeping. I’m glad to share this experience and skill with her. I was fortunate to have an elementary school teacher show me how powerful meditation and journaling was at an early age, but didn’t have a way to reintroduce it into my adult life AND share it with my daughter till now.

There are times when I am okay and can sleep, but recently it hasn’t been that easy.   So I turn to the app and I am usually out in 15 minutes.  I have yet to make it thru a story.  

I was recently able to use the kids stories on two of my young god children.  I was babysitting one night and they just could not lay down.  I played one of the stories for them... they were not even a year old yet.  I timed it.  SEVEN MINUTES and they were down and out.   SEVEN MINUTES... what a blessing.

I simply love the app.  If you question the benefits of paying for premium membership just keep in mind the monthly fee wouldn’t even pay for  a month’s medication so I am just fine paying for
extra content each month.  Especially since I KNOW it works.

I wish there was a way to load multiple stories at once, like a playlist so they could just start one after the other. 2. I would love it if when you pulled up a story or at the end of a story they had maybe like 3 other story suggestions that were similar to what you had just picked.

The Commercial Airliner, and the White Sound Ocean Surf soundscapes are the best IMO for this kind of “sound machine” feel.
However, there are two notable issues I find pretty frustrating:
1. The soundscape tracks are seemingly loops that repeat every X minutes (maybe 20, or 30minutes?). When the track ends, there’s a gap of a couple seconds before it’s starts again, which is enough to create this unpleasant “wake up” experience.
2. The playback experience in the app is buggy. It does not really say when it’s buffering (if at all?) but it does not always starts right away after selecting a soundscape, even though the playback UI shows as playing. Sometimes, playback does not even start until a couple seconds after backgrounding the app. That’s odd and not user friendly.

It is deliberately misleading that you don’t straight up post the cost in the App Store. It is heavily implied that although there is the option of purchasing a premium version, there is still a free version. Which you *technically* DO…however, there is literally next to nothing in the free version and you know it. At the very least, you could have a tab or search option for the free/basic content, but you don’t even do that. Nor do you offer an option to pay monthly, but instead insist we fork over a chunk of cash yearly. It’s a lot easier for me - and I’m sure I’m not alone - to pay, say, $8-10/month than to shell it all out at once (even though, yes I know, the yearly cost would be cheaper overall). Not only that, but even if I could easily spare $70 for a year, some of us are hesitant to plunk down so much cash for a commitment to an app for that long.

Lastly, I cannot stand that when I open this app, the first thing I see is a command: “Take a deep breath.” *You* take a deep breath. Stop telling me what to do with my breath — that is something I control, and it’s no concern of yours.

TLDR: App is poorly designed; make sure you like Tamara Levits way of speaking before subscribing bc she’s 90% of the guided meditations:

1) The app is very confusing to navigate, which when half asleep is especially frustrating. I surprised that there is no one clear place to see all of your saved/fav recordings. Also, ever meditation has a huge picture which seems ok for people new to the app, but unnecessary for whose who just want to find what they're looking for. These things can easily be fixed and I hope they do something about it. 

2) After I finished beginning mediation course, I realized 90% of the other guided meditations  are by Tamara Levitt. I understand a lot of people probably like how she speaks (vocal fry, trying too hard to sound soothing), but I find it too distracting.

The interface is not good for sleepers.  Controls should be large, obvious and omnipresent.  Mucking around with controls is disruptive for sleep and for those of us who do not sleep with our glasses on, (read everybody) very frustrating.

The subscription model for this is very expensive.  The idea that new stories and content is an important aspect for sleep is flawed.  Good content does not need to be replaced as familiarity only helps with falling asleep.
