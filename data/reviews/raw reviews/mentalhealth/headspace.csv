2023-04-11 16:57:43,"The app that I chose to review is called Headspace, and it is a meditation app that helps manage stress by showing mindfulness excercises, and offers information on how to manage other things such as anxiety or worry. This app did an amazing job at helping me be more mindful throughout the day. In the ""Headspace library"", there were tabs for certain scenarios like ""navigating injustice, reframe stress and relax, mindful money, anger/sadness/growth, mindful eating, and guide to sleep,"". Each tab had different podcasts and meditation methods that corresponded to that subject. I enjoyed using this app because as a person who worries often, this tool allowed me to take time out of my day to clear my head and do something that betters my mental health. This app is relevant to abnormal psychology because it includes ways to manage anxiety and worry. Although it is not an app that diagnoses or properly treats symptoms of anxiety, it does relieve some worry by the various methods used in the app; it helps people who may want to feel better, but may not be ready to see a professional, don't have access to proper mental healthcare, or wants to try something quick that is available by simply pulling out their phone. Overall, this app was a game-changer for me as freshman in college, and it is a great way to meditate and reflect, all while teaching me how to manage my constant worry I feel throughout my day.",5,False,This is a very useful app!,Kaysoph,

They even have things for families & kids. I’ve grown into a better person in all aspects of my life and was able to accomplish things that the “old” me would’ve never imagined. I’ve learned so much over these 2 years about myself and the world around me. Andy and Eve were the first ones I started listening to & then they got Kessonga and Dora who I felt even closer to (through culture, headspace and their added vulnerability to speak about their lives on a level I could relate with). I truly believe in investing in my mental health & have tried other guided meditation apps, but never truly connected with them & it never impacted my life like Headspace. I decided to joined Headspace in 2020 & started with the monthly payments. March 2022 I upgraded to the yearly membership. 14,601 minutes later, I can honestly say it’s the BEST thing I’ve ever given myself. TLDR: If you’re thinking about trying headspace, give the 30 day free trial a run and with consistent practice, you‘ll want to  invest your money in your mental healthy too!

2021-08-08 13:26:01,"I began using this application a few years back, in the middle of my college career. I was so stressed out at that time that I could hardly perform day-to-day tasks and I was so broke that I certainly couldn't afford help from a specialist. 
Enter HeadSpace. I found the app through an online search and began a free trial to try to calm my tumultuous inner consciousness. Though I cannot say that the improvements in my thoughts and behavior were immediate, the guidance of Andy's voice (the only option at that time and still my personal favorite) did help to calm me in times of immediate need. If nothing else, this app taught me to breath. My father was so impressed by my lack of mouth-breathing that he took up the monthly fee once it began and I have used Head Space (now on my own dime, thank you) ever since. 
Anyway, whether you are looking for help breathing, getting into shape, falling to sleep, or in quieting those misguided negative inner-voices that come to plague the chronically unhappy, HeadSpace has something for you (often more than one thing, in fact). If you're reading this and thinking about a trial or a membership, give it a shot. It's a judgment-free, stress-free, and until your trial runs out, a free-free way of beginning the mission to exploring and conquering anxiety and exestential dread.

And what are the first sessions, I decided to do a breathing exercise which I realize the instructor was having us focus on breathing from our chest. I’ve done almost the exact same breathing exercise in my abnormal psychology class but then main difference was headspace how do you focus on your chest and breathing through there instead of what we did in my abnormal psychology class which was breathing through your stomach and focusing on there.I have learned through my psychology class that breathing exercises can help people with anxiety by increasing the oxygen exchange which is known to reduce your blood pressure and slow your heart rate these two factors combined have been shown to also release tension that has been held in your abdomen. for example when you were panicking your abdomen tightens and constricts your ability to breathe which often times makes you panic more. Breathing exercises also work because the increase supply of oxygen to your brain stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system which helps promote a sense of calmness throughout you and you begin to calm down. Although some of their breathing techniques are different from what I have learned in my psychology classes this is still an app that is known for meditation and breathing exercises that can really help.",4,False,Compared to what I have learned in my PSY classes,asndnsjsjfjansndbajxjsn,
2021-08-03 16:26:06,"I was introduced to meditation more than 25 years ago and have had a relatively steady practice. So why do I use Headspace? Like any practice it is tempting to slack off or feel like you “got” all the benefits and do not need to do it anymore. Other times it can feel like one is alone in the practice and it becomes hard to motivate oneself. Headspace helps me stay motivated and consistent. And no matter how long one has practiced, having a community of meditators is very helpful to continue practicing. I also have a tendency to get bored with things including meditation, so the variety of approaches, techniques, and goals provided keep it fresh. During 2020 I really appreciated the improvements made by Headspace especially the daily conversations by other meditators, the addition of the Move feature, and the Sleep tools. These were very helpful to keep my spirits up, my body moving, and my meditation practice on track. I also discovered the Pro series for advanced meditators. I am listening to it for a second time because as I have learned in my practice, you are never “done” learning and growing as a meditator. The same session at a different time gives you different insights. I am grateful to the Headspace team for creating and continually evolving the app to meet the challenges of today.

2021-02-11 06:22:38,"You won’t regret buying a Headspace subscription. I often joke with people that Headspace is the one thing I would want to take with me to a desert island. If I were to cancel all of my subscriptions today, Headspace is the one exception I would make. I’m a high school English teacher, and our administration put together a month-long mindfulness education program for our students shortly after I subscribed. I had already raved to many of them about the app and the benefits of taking a couple of minutes out of their day to sit and be present. Lo and behold, Andy pops up on the next slide as our Ted Talk speaker of the day! On a more serious note, I suffer from debilitating chronic pain. I’m currently on long-term disability and a leave of absence from the classroom. Mindfulness, and the courses on managing pain, have been a tremendous help in my journey. Not only that, but I struggle with insomnia. My favorite part of Headspace, because of my (admittedly) vivid imagination, are the sleepcasts. I love falling asleep to Rainday Antiques. I can’t imagine doing anything but that ever again. I have learned to manage stress and anxiety in a way that I had never thought was possible. I have meditated in the waiting room of The Cleveland Clinic before my appointments. I once laughed at the idea of mindfulness and meditation. Now it’s an integral part of my life.

2021-01-18 17:14:21,"This app has given me tools to deal with constant change. This past year, I’ve needed to pivot every day to face some new challenge outside as an essential worker, and at home in isolation with my partner. The tools I Iearned to use to be present in the moment and to accept change has benefited my partner and colleagues at work as much as my own peace of mind. I have very little control over my environment, but I can see my reaction, accept the emotions that rise up, and move on instead of getting lost or bound by them.
This app has also benefited me by helping me get through insomnia. Sometimes it helps me get to sleep in the first place. Mostly it gives me tools to use to calm my mind and body when I wake up in the night buffeted by anxiety or lingering frustration from the day. 
Lastly, this app has given me a language to express the emotional upheaval and troubling questions that I used to just call anxiety. Naming what makes me feel upset has brought clarity to what can feel like a tempest at the time and allow me to look at my thoughts or, rather, face them. After acknowledging them, I can let them go. Sometimes I’m better at that than at other times.

  But as soon as i tried it and put in considerable effort to be consistent*, i was hooked. I could feel the difference between a day i remembered to practice and when i forgot to. I loved it so much i started taking time throughout my day to practice, sometimes in my car/somewhere else by myself, or sometimes I’d take a minute to just focus on my breathing or the sounds around me or how my body felt.

  Then i went through a big life change occurred that i allowed to take me away from the practice for over a year and a half. Now I’m here to say that the me that was consistently practicing vs the me now are not even close. I’m struggling to get back in the swing of this because i desperately miss the emotional stability and overall sense of ease i had. I just need to take it one day at a time and remember that it’s a process, there’s no such thing as doing meditation perfectly.

2022-01-25 18:41:15,"For anyone with the slightest doubt about whether or not they should begin (or continue) their meditation practice with Headspace, do yourself the greatest favor of your life and do it - surrender to whatever is holding you back and I PROMISE you will blow your own mind with everything you will gain from it. Just trust, put in the time (even 5 minutes a day) and the rewards you will reap from it will speak for themselves. As someone who was a vicious doubter, non-believer, and did not think it was humanly possible to get me to sit still for even 1 minute - I didn’t realize that the thing that I was most resistant to, was actually the thing that I needed the most. I am now going on 3 years with headspace happier, healthier (used to suffer from terrible GERD), more compassionate, resilient, focused, and more. It brought attention to my mindless eating habits and even helped me lose weight (and keep it off). I didn’t realize that I was living in a ‘cloud’, on auto-pilot until headspace helped bring me back to myself. Today, my cure for EVERYTHING (bad day, good day, breakup, can’t focus, bad mood, feeling anxious, grumpy, lethargic, etc.) is to sit down and do a 10 minute meditation.

2021-05-17 19:06:05,"I heard about this app on tv and saw ads in The Today section of the App Store. I decided to give it a try and it really does help me out. I feel less stressed, calm, and feel ready for anything. It’s like a guide or tool which helps push you to be a better you. So then comes the question, is it worth it? I think so. For instance if you have ADHD or feel stressed most days (maybe because of work or school) use this. 

Everything is not sunshine and rainbows. For one, $13 to me feels somewhat pricey. Other meditation apps that I found are cheaper than what Headspace currently offers. Another thing is that it lacks free content. There’s only very little that Headspace offers and it’s not a lot. It’s almost as if your forced into paying for a subscription in order to use it. I really didn’t want to do that and I have now canceled it since I felt that it was overly priced. 

Headspace is great and I may say that’s is better than most apps I’ve used. But I don’t like the fact that after going through the tutorial it locks most of the content Headspace offers you and forces you into a subscription that feels overly priced. Yeah, they give you a free trial but after that your pretty much forced. Offer more videos that are free and let people decide for themselves.

I have some experience with meditation and mindfulness and it’s helped me in the past but I’ve never been able to stick with it for more than a couple of weeks at a time. Then one day while listening to Huberman’s podcast there was a month free trial and I decided to try it since I’ve always wanted to give this app a go anyway. WELL, let me tell you...this app is changing my life. I am proud to say I am on my 33rd day streak. I can feel myself overall being more present and aware throughout the day. Now, when I start to feel anxious I almost immediately catch myself and can begin using some of the tools and practice I’ve accumulated from headspace. I do want to add though, the key word is PRACTICE. Medication, like Andy says, is a skill and like any skill you must practice. By practicing enough, it does truly become second nature. I know it’s only been a month but I can already feel the difference and I am looking forward to the future. Thank you headspace team. P.S every little thing about this app is great.

2021-10-26 21:43:24,"I truly enjoy using the headspace app, and after my free trial it was no question for me to buy the subscription. Others may say it is a little pricey, but the amount of features and genuine support included in this app is incredible. As someone who had to stop going to therapy appointments because of the cost, meditation has been a grounding practice for me, and this app really has a meditation for every scenario. I especially like the SOS section, where you can find small meditations for when you’re feeling burnt out or anxious. Another great feature is the sleep section, especially sleep casts. The calming stories really help me unwind, and there are new ones coming out all the time.

 The app interface itself is also very well designed, calming and minimal. I enjoy how you cannot browse the app while listening to a meditation or sleep cast as well — a subtle touch that reminds me to stay present!

I would definitely recommend this app (and also all the headspace podcasts) to someone who would like to let go of unwanted habits and build self kindness.

It was really helpful so when I left rehab I was looking for something to help me continue that practice. I had seen & used Headspace on Netflix so I decided to try out the app. I have used it every single day since I got it. It has been a crucial part of my recovery, giving me new coping skills & teaching me to be present in the moment. I was someone who thought meditation & all that stuff didn’t work. I am thrilled to say Headspace has proven me wrong. I just celebrated one year clean! 
I could go on & on about how great this app is & how much it has to offer because there is SO MUCH more to this app than meditation but I’ll leave it there. I HIGHLY recommend you try Headspace.
There are two small things I’d change about the app….
I’d love it if “Today’s Meditation” could be saved like other things can. Those are usually very helpful & something I’d like to be able to go back to.
Also the Sleepcasts. It would be great if you could fast forward. Sometimes I don’t want/need the wind down, I just want the story to start so I can fall asleep. Besides, there’s already a separate section for wind downs.",5,False,Worth every penny & then some,Hhdyhstshcjbotex,

However, at some point over the last year or so, this app has become absurdly difficult to navigate and find what I want. What used to be a simple and elegant interface and experience is no longer so. I don’t know if this is an attempt to encourage users to see more of what the app offers or what, but the result for me, a long time user (and not some technophobic grandfather) is frustration and wasted time. I still use the app daily, but please, consider simplifying it back to more the way it used to be, when there were more clearly organised sections for finding the meditation I want. You have some kind of impossible to meld with structure now. It’s terribly laid out with all kinds of weird and distracting subcategories and stuff I don’t care about.

I travel quite a bit and I love that I’m able to pick my environment of choice to meditate. I always thought meditation meant quieting your thoughts etc... but when I learned that it was part of being mindfulness and being present in the now it helped immensely in my day to day well being. When I did the anxiety course that really helped in so many ways because I thought you could get rid of it.

But the thing is since I don’t have premium, I have to keep on repeating the same old things like the rain day antiques sleepcast I’ve heard that sleep cast so many times and now I keep getting annoyed with it. That goes the same with the other sleep stuff too like the sleep music I’ve heard “doze” so many times I wake up like every 30 minutes or so. Also goes the same with the two free wind downs. The first time I used the free wind downs I fell asleep instantly the second time after that I couldn’t sleep for ten minutes. So after that, I wanted to do a free trial for the premium but I didn’t realize I was short on money. Since most people do a free trial for like a week or so they cancel there payment the day before the payment is due. So I tried doing that but it asked for but then I realized they need to know my payment information before doing my free trial. I think it was because they don’t know if I’m gonna cancel my payment or actually do the payment.

Kind of stalls progress of the meditation itself when you’ve just worked so hard to pull yourself back, only to be instantly asked for money right after. From a company stand point I also think it would be more beneficial to work on building value and then freely offering the option to see what monthly costs are and also show a detailed description of what’s involved with a paid membership.

I thought it was great, but wanted to shop around and see what all of the individual meditation apps had to offer, but Headspace is the clear winner. I signed up for an annual subscription (and I hardly ever do that). The general organization of the interface is great in its simplicity, because you can easily toggle between the app’s different features with the navigation on the bottom, and there’s only five options so it’s aesthetically pleasing to me. Speaking of aesthetics, the graphics shown while meditating are very uplifting, simple, and non-intimidating. I think apps like Calm that have the ability to show/do nature sounds are cool, but that feels like too many decisions as to what graphic to choose. The soft Australian accent that Andy has is very calming but feels more non-judgmental, like an old friend who’s just being your guide through the meditation.

Today, The Wake Up was about setting realistic and healthy goals for yourself, burnout, and more. The most important thing that I heard, however, was that the speaker themselves have a disability that impacts their work and goal setting. It made me tear up to hear about Amanda Morris’ perspective on running yourself down trying to meet expectations and lofty goals. “This is someone I trust to talk about this,” I thought. 
Headspace not only champions helpful and relevant information, it seems to champion diversity in the way that really matters: who, with the most real experience with this problem, can be trusted to be the face of this process as users work through it? I see how you put users needs and concerns first. It’s wonderful. It is bare minimum - but it is wonderful and should be said.

During this time in my life i was extremely overwhelmed with my own emotions and could barely complete or comprehend day to day task. When i had breakdowns i would use headspace to recollect myself and calm down my racing thoughts. i have always been spiritual and into meditation, so finding an app that helps with guided meditation practices and unusual sleeps schedules made me feel good and comfortable. It made me feel like i was getting back to myself. I recently learned in my Psy class that controlled breathing can help with sudden outbursts or breakdowns, as well as meditation. We once did a an activity in class similar to the breathing techniques on headspace and doing this activity made me feel as if i was doing something right within my mental well being since i brought it upon myself to experience the usage of headspace.",5,False,very helpful!,LisswLocs,

I fall asleep fairly easily in the evening, but my anxiety sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night. On the evenings where I use Headspace to calm my mind down with the radio app of relaxing sounds and/or the night time meditation, I usually am less likely to have anxiety in the middle of the night and am more likely to sleep through the night. Sometimes I’ll use the app in the middle of the night to calm down my mind. This is a very professionally produced app that you can tell is well researched.

Critical race theory attempts to add concepts such as privilege to push you to act in a particular way not necessarily aligned with your deepest intuitions and compassionate motivations.

I continued with Andy’s sessions for a long time before I cud begin to incorporate the techniques in my daily life.  It remains a significant challenge but including different perspective when I’m caught in an escalating anxiety moment and to be able to objectify the anxiety from my person has improved my life tremendously.

I’ve been having ALOT of stress in my life, from school, to siblings, to friends, to the sleeping disorders and the depressions. To the lost loved ones and moving houses. 

I’ve become so stressed that I become really sick. I’ve developed this thing called “Anxiety Nausea” I became so sick I thought I was dying! Headspace has helped me deal with and understand with what’s happening with my body, and I appreciate it! 

I recommend this app to ANYONE. Even if you don’t suffer from bad anxiety or any disorder, I still recommend. It helps you a lot, and you may learn something you never knew about your body before. 

From the help of my family and headspace, I’m recovering. To anyone going through this, or something similar, you will recover. And you’ll find people who support you. If you don’t, find a hobby! Or go out on a walk! 

And yeah.. maybe anxiety will never go away.. but you can help your body by knowing some solutions to help! Treat your body with the kindness and respect it deserves.

Instead of feeling relaxed I would quickly feel panicked and found breathing difficult. When I first began meditating with Andy, I immediately tried the guided meditation for dealing with anxiety. It was so comforting to learn that my anxious tendencies resulted in overly trying to control my breath and in turn created an unhealthy pattern. I took heart knowing that if it was on his app, surely this must be something many others have faced. With his expert guidance I have learned to look forward to meditation and how it relaxes my body and mind. As I have explored the app more, I find that Andy has addressed many other hurdles I have had with meditating.

The app looks really nice, but I wish there was a way to give feedback about what mindfulness practices work best for you, so you only get personalized recommendations for mindfulness. For instance, counting breaths has the opposite effect for me (draws me out of a mindfulness state), so it is frustrating when I’m 5+ minutes into a mindfulness exercise and they drop a breath counting exercise in there. The persistent in-app pop-up notifications are obnoxious—it is amazing to me that someone making a _mindfulness_ app doesn’t understand that pop-ups are always unwelcome interruptions.

But the main lesson plan is literally so repetitive, there are no options for longer sessions beyond just below 15 min, and there is a lack of true depth in the programming.

My favorite part of it is the “today” view that gives me a custom tab of meditations and “the wake up” which is a carefully curated video series that covers an array of useful subjects. The sleep casts are amazing because of how thoughtfully each are put together. They made the app a full experience with thoughtful art and music to go along with their meditations and videos.

1 - this app has helped me so much in terms of better sleep quality (I love using the Sleepcasts) the visualizations and wind downs within the Sleepcasts and elsewhere in the sleep sections will send you right to sleep.

2 - All of the voices are so soothing (I personally love Eve and Yohannes) 

3 - So I use the sleep section (Sleepcasts, slee radio, soundscapes, wind downs, nighttime SOS which is a very handy little tool btw that I’ve never seen in other apps) and I also use the regular meditation section both of which have helped me immensely in finding peace and grounding myself in times of need. I’m currently doing the 10 course kindness meditations and it’s honestly very helpful in finding time to show myself kindness (each session is about 10 minutes or so)

A good deal of the anxiety I had been experiencing daily has gone away, without any change in external circumstance. Meditation has helped me slow down and learn to breathe and be calm. I feel more agency over my mood and internal well-being. My wife has commented many times on how present I seem (and how grateful she is for that!).

Headspace Move, the exercise program, focuses on a mindful approach to physical exercise, something I had never experienced before, and it has added a good deal of joy to my physical routine. The video production and design work are outstanding, as is the coaching. I do wish, however, that there was a bit more emphasis on form throughout the workouts – if I did not have previous experience with some of the exercises, I might be a bit lost as to how to do them properly and without risk of injury. That said, the emphasis on being gentle and listening to the body each day has certainly helped.

2021-09-22 17:41:41,In my opinion Headspace is a useful tool for anxiety and all the physical symptoms that affect someone who suffers from it. This app does a good job providing the breathing techniques and mediations that help calm the storm in your mind that is anxiety. In my abnormal psychology class textbook there are physical symptoms of how anxiety affects the body. Headspace does a good job slowing your heart rate and controlling your breathing which I turn controls your mind trying to tell you that something is wrong when there isn’t. Anxiety also affects your sleep and headspace offers meditations that help the common worries that keep someone who suffers from anxiety awake. That is why I believe headspace is a useful app for people with anxiety.,5,False,Headspace review,geesetaylor,

These are guided sleep stories/hypnosis/meditation with ambience that did more to help my insomnia than anything else. I kept my Headspace subscription literally just for them. 

I no longer use Headspace or do mindfulness because I prefer more advanced practices, but it’s nice to come back to every now and again. The graduation from Headspace is realizing that meditation is so much more than the westernized version of it.

Headspace also provides 6-hr music. The problems here are 1) six hours isn’t a complete sleep cycle (same problem of waking up when the sound ends), and 2) this music isn’t as good at putting us to sleep as the sleepcasts. 

Headspace must know that sleepcasts are effective precisely because they are comprised of these nonsense stories that the brain can’t hold on to because the details aren’t a complete narrative. 

I’ve sent in this feedback before, and based on comments I see online about people with sleep disturbance who really need a full-night soundtrack, I really would have hoped Headspace would have created at least a few sleepcasts that last 8 hours.

2022-12-20 13:52:26,"Like I said, as a beginner, this app really helped me understand and practice. But as I move through the pro series courses, I find a few things increasingly frustrating.

First, the “today’s meditation” has no scaling on the number of mid-session prompts based on your level. I’m becoming increasingly comfortable with more prolonged silence in pro level 2. Then I do a today’s meditation. I like the beginning of these sessions and the different ideas they offer, but I wish I could turn off all mid-session prompts, just receiving the quick intro and then the transition out of the session.

Last I checked we are still in the middle of a pandemic {dunno about y’all} but as I write this mid-February 2022, my hospital has never been more overwhelmed with COVID patients, sick staff, and hemorrhaging employees- most are our best workers too! Healthcare workers are flat out leaving the field. And not just us. Teachers too! 

Many are also suffering from the loss of loved ones, isolation, and forfeiting dreams {our olympians are not immune to COVID}. 

Anyone who wants to profit off that suffering is disgusting and… well, this is why I don’t have mental health apps on my phone.  If anyone knows of one that’s COMPLETELY FREE TO ALL- and I don’t mean a “free version” where you end up paying for extras, do let me know. I will 100% support that.

I think there’s something for everyone—regardless of background—to benefit from in the app. My partner and I enjoy doing meditations and Move exercises together. They seem to always be adding more and improving in ways that I previously had silently wished they would. As for possible improvements, I’d really like to be able to “shuffle” or choose a random sleepcast, specifically. Also, it would be nice if I could rewind the sleepcast, as sometimes I miss the beginning or certain parts while I’m settling in, or still have stuff on my mind from the day and don’t want to go through the whole wind down exercise again. Another suggestion—and this may just be an issue with my older Apple TV—if I could airplay the video along with the audio (Move exercises, The Wake Up) that would be fantastic as right now only audio plays on the tv while I have to watch the fitness instructor from the phone. One last thing, how about Apple Watch compatibility? That would be delightful and I would use it even more often.

2023-03-28 02:33:34,"This is an incredible app. It provides everything you would ever need to do literally anything. Just for sleep alone, there are meditations, soundscapes, music, radio and so much more (my personal favorite are the sleepcasts). There are entire sections devoted to just about everything. The only problem is that it can get a bit overwhelming. A lot of the existing sections don’t have much to do with mindfulness. Now that being said, most of the ones that don’t are still great. Since I intend to be an author one day, the sleepcasts provide a soothing way to ease myself into sleep while also telling great stories in imaginative settings. This app really deserves more like 4 and a 1/2 stars, but, as that is not an option, it will be getting 5 stars instead (4.5 rounds to 5). I would have a much harder time sleeping without this app and I don’t necessarily believe that anything has to be removed. I just think that it would be nice if it was a bit more organized. I only have one final criticism. Once upon a time, many years ago, there was a button that played a random sleepcast. Since I am incredibly lazy, I would very much like it if this was reinstated. It’s fine if it isn’t, but since I can already see how that would be coded, I don’t think that it’s (programming wise) much of a challenge for the incredible designers working at Headspace.

2021-10-18 18:14:19,"I have been challenged with TBI and the recovering journey has been trying. After a long bout with symptoms and coping on my own, thankfully I was introduced to a TBI rehabilitation program. There are specific techniques used within that program that I have not been able to find anywhere else, until coming to find this app Headspace. My desire is that when I am outside of the TBI program I can continue my healing journey in a mindful way. I am not one to sign up for subscriptions, however this is truly an exception and well worth its value. The tools and approach of this app are realistic for day to day use, practical in all circumstances, and valuable. This isn’t just breathing, this isn’t just music, this app is set apart from all others out there. It provides education, mindful stretching, yoga, wake up and wind down meditation, and so on. All areas we forget about when our day begins, all those moments in between can now have guidance to a better response to life and outcome. As a TBI patient there are limitations unfortunately, noise, sound, colors, etc. There are highs and lows and coming to grips with that is a feat all to itself. This app is incredibly calming it allows the moment to be and pass naturally as it may. It is a must have, whether you are improving your quality of life or whether you are medically challenged… this is a diverse app that speaks to all. It will meet you where you’re at, just as you are and you’ll always leave with more that you came with. What a god send.

2022-11-18 03:57:18,"I have used this app for about two years now and it has helped me in so many aspects of my life. From breathing techniques all the way to positive affirmations, this app has everything you need to become less stressed and anxious. I have lived most of my life with anxiety and being an athlete has also led to increased levels of stress in my everyday life. I have always heard that meditation can possibly help with these symptoms I have faced with generalized anxiety, but up until recently I didnt know that there was actual science behind the forms of 'therapy' that these meditations and techniques teach me. This app has something called ""Wind downs"" which I still use almost every night because they help to calm my busy mind before falling asleep. One feature that is one of my favorites to use on this app is the ""daily meditation"". This section of the app has great positive ways to start your morning and has motivational speakers along with simple breathing exercises in order to prepare your mind for the day ahead. These techniques have been researched by the psychology field and it is proven that reshaping your ways of viewing yourself and attitudes can lead to positive results when living with generalized anxiety. 

Overall, I love this app and highly recommend it. I started with the free plan-which is still amazing and offers so many free resources to help you 'calm your mind', but I then got the subscription through the student plan and have noticed such a difference in the overall ways that I think about myself, and I truely think it has to do with increase mindfulness that this app has allowed me to tap into.",5,False,Great meditation and breathing app for people with anxiety or generalized stress,kenzie.1492,

This app has helped me so much! When I am suffering from stress, health anxiety, or fibro/stress related body pains I turn to this app and go through some meditations with the teachers. It’s an excellent way for me to relax. Calm my mind. Stop thinking about myself. And to recover in the moment. Hopefully in time this will help me heal, as previously I’ve just been getting worse and worse without any therapy since my therapist’s practice permanently shutdown from COVID. This has been a great help and is something I can just pull out of my pocket and sit in my bedroom for a bit to calm down. Well worth the 1 year subscription price I’ve paid. Thank you! 😊🙏🏻 *There is only one thing that I’d change. This would be for some of the workout audios. I need to walk a lot for a heart condition I have (which is a big cause of my health anxiety), and I’d love to see the audios for walks and runs to be a bit longer. The longest run audio I see is 20 minutes, when recommended cardio workout lengths realistically should be at least 30 minutes. I’d really like to have an audio similar to the bedtime audios that are lengthy, have soothing talk, and tips to reduce anxiety made to be listened while walking. And if there could be a variety to choose from. Overall this would be the only change I can think of. An hour long walk audio to help calm my mind. 😁❤️",5,False,It’s a Miracle App!,JacobHuggins,

2021-04-15 08:08:47,"I have had a subscription to this app for a very long time. I first started using it for sleep.  I could never fall asleep... I would toss and turn for hrs, sometimes all night and not even get a min of sleep. This was extremely frustrating and it was affecting many aspects of my life in a negative way.  I have chronic back pain, and I could never get comfortable, so I thought about this pain all night. My mind racing, knowing that I had work in the morning and I was just miserable.  So, I started using the wind downs.  I incorporated that with a beginners course on meditation.  After some time and practice, I was beginning to see real improvement.  Then I added the sleep stories, I didn’t think they would work at first, because I believed that the story would have me too focused on the story and not fall asleep. Again, after a week or two, I was falling asleep before the story ended.  Then I did the pain course...to help me understand my relationship with pain.  It did wonders. Over months I was dedicating at least one time a day to meditation.  I also have anxiety, and have been working on that.  But there is so much more on this app. Yoga, healthy eating, music, and a lot of helpful info and meditations.  I have tried other apps while using this one. Some were pretty good and some just weren’t for me. This app is honestly an app I can’t live without.  I love it!  I am living a healthier lifestyle and also sleeping so much better. I recommend this app to ANYONE & everyone.  They add new courses and different aspects to it all the time.  I will NEVER cancel this app.  I have begun to look at life different.

I ended up purchasing the app because overtime I've noticed how it has enhanced my everyday living and honestly made life a little bit easier. The things that would stress me out no longer stressed me out as much because I was able to control my mind due to the breathing techniques. In my abnormal psychology class, we learned that anxiety appears in various conditions and looks different for everyone. Anxiety as an emotion can have three different components: physical response, cognitive symptoms and avoidance or escape. For me, I find myself most anxious at night worried about the future and the safety of myself and loved ones. So at night I would refer to the app the most and try what helped me the most… which would be the breathing techniques. In class we tried breathing techniques as well but the difference is being at home is much more relaxing than being in a class with 20+ students. We learned that breathing exercises increases oxygen, which slows down your heart rate and reduces your blood pressure. Not to mention that once an abundance of oxygen is exposed in your body, it will eventually reach your brain and nervous system. The anxiousness in one’s body is then replaces with a plethora of calmness. This app is really great for anyone who would like to reach a sense of mindfulness through a variety of breathing techniques, sleepcasts, meditation. The app offers way more than what I listed but those were the most helpful for me.",5,False,More than an app,auentaisja,

2022-07-30 01:32:21,"About seven years ago, I was in the most consistent meditation practice of my life, meditating twice a day every day for 15-30 minutes. Looking back, this practice helped cultivate the most inner peace and stability I’ve ever felt. I’ve fallen on and off the bandwagon since, but this app has sincerely helped me get back on track in such an easy way. It is designed to help people who may feel uncomfortable with the idea of mediation, to help those who think they’re “doing it wrong” or for those who have trouble sitting still or in silence. I think a lot of people misunderstand the “point” of meditation; Headspace does well to illustrate that the point is to slow down an overactive mind so that we can observe, but not attach ourselves to, the deluge of thoughts in order to create inner space so that you can see the world around you more clearly and without judgment. Additionally, Headspace keeps track of the minutes you’ve spent meditating and the daily streak of checking in, which are just little things that help to make us feel good about the time we’ve spent and to make it a little easier to hold ourselves accountable for taking care of ourselves. Whether you are prone to depression or anxiety, have difficulties falling asleep, trouble managing your priorities or letting anger get the best of you, among many other issues people face on a daily basis, there is a mediation (often several!) that, with CONSISTENT practice, will help to minimize those difficulties in daily life.

2021-02-04 16:07:51,"My son bought me Headspace for my birthday 🥳 last year after I had talked with him about a perceived crisis I was having. My son is 38, I am 68 and we are very close. He said “do you meditate?” I thought then said “well no I wouldn’t know where to start.” When my birthday rolled around he told me he purchased a year of Headspace so I could learn to meditate. That is the most thoughtful gift 🎁 I have ever received. I was feeling like I was having a meltdown starting on the inside, so I started the impermanence process. My day starts better with the little bit of time I devote to myself. There are many issues I am working on and the more I examine the list in Headspace I see they have a session for each issue. I am certainly on a journey that is aiding me with the tools and skills to manage issues better. I use to have a difficult time getting to sleep and now I put on Rainday Antiques to help me sleep and I have yet to hear it to the end... I am sleeping very well. With the discipline of having the breathing to center me and give me a moment or two to get a perspective rather than react I feel much more in control. I am so not there yet (where ever there is 😂) and I feel that Headspace will always have a session for me on this wonderful journey my son gifted me.  After a bit of Headspace I feel able to meet my day with the idea every day is a journey of something different and exciting to explore.

2021-06-15 01:49:50,"Headspace’s meditation teachers taught me so much about mindfulness and I’ve been mediating afford two years as a high schooler. And Andy was a former Buddhist monk, so I learned sooo much about mindfulness that it’s improving my quality of life A LOT. There are so many things I want to say but I want to keep this short. Even though mediation sounds ‘dumb’ for some people, Headspace is the very opposite; it gives me mindfulness tips and follow up with a mediation, making the mindfulness lesson more memorable, and what I learned so far (and all of them are so freaking helpful) are: observe thoughts instead of reacting and getting carried away with them, if we’re reacting to thoughts we are keeping the emotion alive, adding more fuel to the fire; let’s thoughts come and go, with a gentle or effortless focus; having a daydream sense of mind let’s us take things less seriously and it gives us more freedom, and sooooo many more (I can’t remember all at the moment). But some improvements I’d want to see are: being able to review the daily mediations in the “Today” tab, because they are so freaking useful and I want to keep listening to them, I don’t want them to be just “daily”, I want it to exist in the library forever; another improvement is that it’s kind of expensive for high schoolers, and since I’m a high schooler and I think this app should be used more by students, I think it should have a reduced price for high schoolers as well (thankfully I got a free one-year trial and I’m waiting for the sale, because I’m paying using my own money).",5,False,"Sounds cheesy but this changed my life, and it still continues to as I use it everyday",Kid backwards,

2021-09-16 13:48:26,"I was just diagnosed with breast cancer and overwhelmed with fear and other emotions. The “coping with cancer” meditations are very helpful, particularly what Andy says at the beginning and end of each session. I’d like to recommend two improvements: (1) make each session longer - perhaps 15-20 minutes or more, as a lot of emotions come up during the “distracted” moments and a longer session would help calm back down into the breathing and guided journey; and (2) since coping with cancer is usually a long journey of many months or years, have more packs for coping with the cancer journey so that there is a guided meditation journey of 60 or 90 sessions. Of course, I listen to other packs and the stand alone guided sessions but the cancer journey is unique and Andy’s guidance through it is very meditative as well as therapeutic. I’d also like to suggest you create a 30+ session pack for people with fear of flying (like my younger adult son) in addition to the one-session you have - 30-session pack similar in process of coping as you have for the ‘coping with cancer.’ There are very few fear of flying therapeutic workshops in the country; they are outrageously expensive; and psychological therapy sessions are also very expensive. I believe a headspace pack would help many people. I’ve been a headspace devotee for a couple of years but had ‘lapsed’ until my son reminded me to begin listening and meditating again. I even bought apple blu tooth headphones to listen to headspace on the NYC subway on my long commute to and from work, in addition to listening/meditating at night to help prepare for what been restless sleeps recently.

2021-07-09 06:30:16,"An unbelievable app! I have been using this for meditation and sleep and I have to say it is having a positive affect on my mental health. There are many, many different types of guided meditation courses for different needs and levels of expertise. They have really helped me get into meditating by taking some of the mystery out of it. But as someone who struggles with sleep, the real star of the show are the sleepcasts. If the app was just sleepcasts, I’d still pay full price. The sleepcasts are MASTERPIECES. Whoever is writing these…please give them a raise. Beautifully written, engaging enough to focus your mind but not so gripping that you can’t drift off to sleep (they are detail based not plot based- so someone describing beautiful locations, etc and the paragraphs shift in order so you can’t tell what point in the story you are and get anxious about how much time it’s taking you to fall asleep- genius!). A variety of gentle voices (without being annoyingly whispering), and enchanting soundscapes accompany the stories. There are so many to choose from, it’s overwhelming, and when I put my favorite ones on, it’s like I took a sleeping pill, but with no side affects. I look forward to using them every night. I chose this app over its competitor because I didn’t like the celebrity aspect of the other app- I don’t like lying in bed and thinking, “huh. This is that actor from that movie.” This app is truly a treasure, and I think the low-key vibe of the app (soothing colors, soft voices, cute and creative animations) paired with super high quality features make it truly the best out there.

2023-01-21 15:28:05,"I can’t say enough good things about the content. I did not think I was going to be in to meditation. But the science behind it and it’s benefits to mental and physical health are overwhelming so I gave it a try. The first few sessions I’ll say didn’t do a ton for me but with every additional 10 minute session, the power of this practice to improve my mental heath and well being increases. After 36 sessions I can say it’s been life changing and impacted almost every area of my life. I’m sleeping more now than I have in years. I’m less angry. Even my dreams are better: I used to have mostly nightmares, and now i find myself enjoying my dreams. And this is with pretty sporadic use. I probably average two sessions per week. I’m a doctor and a dad, so I’m busy. But some days I tell myself I don’t have the time NOT to do a 10 minute session, because the improved focus I’m sure makes the day more productive over all. I give four and not 5 stars because of the poorly designed app. The app used to be well organized but it’s just not anymore. I’ll never understand how operations this big and successful end up with such poorly designed apps. Why it can’t just be a catalogue or index, organized rationally by course from beginner to intermediate to advanced, and l with an option to view courses and sessions organized by other topics, I just don’t get. 
[UPDATE: In an earlier version of this review, I criticized the app for not being searchable but they have added a search function. Strong work!!!]

An app like this doesn’t need to be —and I submit should not be— innovative, flashy, quirky, etc. or at least it should not be these things to the detriment of its usability. The focus should be on enabling users to quickly and easily find the content that will benefit them most. They have clearly not focus grouped these features. My wife is a doctor also and she independently arrived at the exact same conclusion: incredible content, incredibly poorly designed app, to the point of interfering with its usefulness. Guys, wake up. But I don’t want to end on a negative. Because the positive FAR FAR outweighs the negative. This is life changing material that will give you skills and tools to improve your quality of life, Reduce depression & anxiety, improve sleep and focus, decrease unhealthy levels of or expressions of anger, improve relationships, and help you make positive changes in your life. All of these have been true for me, and, the science supporting this experience in the typical user is strong. I’m a physician and I recommend this app specifically to most of my patients. Everyone should learn this. It’s not spiritual or new agey or “out there,” or hokey. I have however experienced things while meditating that were quite transcendental.

2021-09-14 10:51:21,"Overall, Headspace should be rated as a four out of five stars app for adolescents. This aesthetically pleasing, mindfulness app encourages users to pause and exist within the present moment as a way of coping with life’s stressors. While most of the content within the app can only be accessed with the purchase of a subscription, there is a free option to help users learn the basic principles of mindfulness. For students specifically, there is a discounted, annual plan available, making the app more affordable for adolescents, who arguably need it the most. With the purchase of this subscription, users have access to pages of organized content, including singles and courses centered on improving mindfulness skills related to focus, movement, sleep, and meditation. Since this app can be used by all ages, content ranges from developmentally appropriate courses for young children to more adult-centered sessions pertaining to pregnancy and unemployment. Furthermore, given the customization options of Headspace, users can choose the length of their session with an option to download content, allowing the app to be used more flexibly when on the go. For those that want to share their mindfulness journey, the app allows options to connect one’s Headspace account to their Facebook account, where users can invite their buddies and update their progress within sessions. When looking at Headspace’s privacy policy, their data-sharing section is vague; however, it appears that Headspace tries to gather minimal data about its users. Along with adding more details to the privacy policy, Headspace can also be improved by adding more accessibility features and movement modifications within their audiovisual content for those with different abilities within the app.",4,False,An App for Adolescents!,Gillbeany,

2022-08-26 11:28:07,"I have been using Headspace plus for 3 years now, and can honestly say it was worth every penny spent. I primarily use the sleep functionalities (sleep casts, winddowns, sleep radio) as I have trouble falling and staying asleep. This app has helped me turn my brain off and focus on sleep. Recently, there was an update though, that changed the interface of the app—layout, design, and now whenever a notification comes through on my phone while using the app, whatever I am listening to will stop playing and when I go into the app, I have to start from the landing page and go into the Sleep section and start the program I was playing from the beginning. For example, when a text message comes through, the Sleepcast I’m listening to will stop playing. As I get notifications all night (mind you, my phone is on do not disturb, so I am not actually hearing the notification come through), the app constantly stops and I have to restart whatever thing I was listening to. This did not used to be the case, in the past, if a notification came through on my phone, the Headspace app would not be interrupted, and would continue to play. I never had to go back into the app during the night. And since I’m a very sensitive sleeper, when the app stops playing I immediately notice, especially if I am not yet fully asleep. I so wish there was a fix for this. I just renewed for another yearly membership, but I’m starting to wondering if there is another option out there for me that will allow me to listen to “white noise-eque background noise” uninterrupted through the night.

2022-02-01 03:46:59,"Headspace is a very easy app to get around, has many options for children and teens, is accessible, and visually appealing. The app is however expensive (if they don’t register with a nonprofit partner), and may not be stimulating enough to keep children coming back. Strategies such as yoga, meditation, and breathing techniques “are helpful for promoting well-being and resilience in youth” and Headspace allows teens to have access to skill building resources that they can take with them wherever they go (Laser & Nicotera, 2021). This access can be incredibly helpful for children who have experienced trauma, as they may not feel comfortable meditating within a large group. Headspace allows them the opportunity to do it on their own in whatever space they feel the most safe in. Meditation and mindfulness training are extremely effective interventions for those who have experienced trauma because they “enlist the whole person, and not just the mind”, as “trauma affects both the mind and body” (Laser & Nicotera, 2021). Headspace has exceeded in the way in which it allows ‘regular’ people to access training and skills about meditation that would have previously been harder to find. The issue however, has to do with the discipline and time commitment needed to truly benefit from the effects of regular practice. Many of the studies that Headspace mentions on its website state the benefits associated with mindfulness for youth. The issue is that in all of these studies, the meditation or mindfulness activities were led by researchers or other people who were able to hold the participants accountable, or remind them to participate. Headspace does offer the choice to be reminded once a day by the app, but it is easy to ignore. I believe that Headspace is very beneficial when used regularly. However, when used sporadically, the effects of mindfulness techniques are fleeting, and truly incorporating those skills into everyday life becomes less attainable. Overall, Headspace is a well-rounded app for adolescents, and may help them alleviate some of their stress or anxiety, in a calming and very accessible manner.",4,False,Headspace for Teens,Micksgeuen,

2023-06-28 11:22:00,"I want to share my enthusiastic recommendation for this incredible meditation app. It offers a wide range of high-quality content and features exceptional teachers, making it an app that I confidently recommend to multiple people. Moreover, their customer service is not only professional but also highly responsive, adding to the overall positive experience.

However, it is worth noting that when I recently decided to cancel my annual subscription, I discovered that they do not provide partial refunds. Even if you have several months remaining on your subscription (in my case, 8 months), they adhere strictly to their policy and do not offer any reimbursement for the unused portion. This policy is clearly outlined in their terms and conditions for auto renewal. I feel it is important to inform my fellow subscribers about this aspect so that they can make an informed decision.

In my personal journey, I eventually switched to another meditation app that better suited my preferences and needs. The content provided by the new app resonated more with my meditation goals, prompting me to explore alternatives. While I still acknowledge the positive aspects of this app, I believe it is essential for individuals to find an app that aligns closely with their interests. Therefore, if you are seeking a meditation app that caters specifically to your preferences, I encourage you to explore other options as well. Regardless of this consideration, I firmly believe in the importance of continuing your meditation practice.

2022-01-30 01:22:43,"Overall, I really enjoyed using the app and have contemplated extending my free trial to a monthly subscription. I would rate the app a 4 out of 5. As a 2nd year grad student, that has a full-time job, runs a small business and is living through a pandemic, I found the Headspace app to be the perfect resource for learning how to manage time for relaxation, self-care and stress management. The Headspace app’s engaging content, user friendly interface, and personally customizable dashboard enabled a hassle free and positive experience. Regarding areas for improvement, I think monthly/annual subscription rates can be negotiated. $13 dollars a month not including in-app purchases is quite high in comparison to similar apps that cost around 3-5 dollars. I think Headspace can expand user accessibility by providing a much larger language selection, as well as incorporating content and instructors that demonstrate diversity, equity and inclusion specifically regarding ableism and age. In the book, Working with Adolescents : A Guide for Practitioners, Julie Anne Laser and Nicole Nicotera explain that teenagers on average spend at least 10 hours each day interacting via social media platforms and the internet. The authors recognize that although media usage among adolescents may present risks for youth, media also presents benefits and can foster community, accessibility to information that impacts youth knowledge and useful programs that teach adolescents how to deal with depression and chronic fatigue. Due to our current life circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic withthe exception of few educational institutions and workplace settings, life in this day and age has transitioned from in person activities to life online. The impact of burn out, stress, physical and mental health concerns on youth and adolescents has dramatically increased. Apps like Headspace offer youthaccessible ways to foster stress management, increase mental and physical health, practice self-care techniques and learn about mindful meditation strategies. As Laser and Nocoteradiscuss, messages received via media have effects on adolescent behavior. In this case, Headspace fosters the belief that individuals can and should create life-changing habits that promote individual and community mental health and wellbeing.",4,False,Apps for Adolescents Review,SOWK 615 SG,

2021-04-17 23:09:02,"I have heard of apps similar to this one before and figured I would give it a try to relax me since with finals are just around the corner and deadlines are getting closer. I decided to put my goal at reducing stress and anxiety and the first thing I got was  prompoted to a “Feeling overwhelmed” talk down to get myself relaxed and calm. The voice was not all that calming and relaxing, but he did have an accent that was very mesmorizing that helped let go of some tension. 

After setting some goals for myself Headspace created a list of things for me to accomplish throughout the day and the first thing was to take five deep breaths. What I loved about this was the music was very calming, but still had some upbeats it helped with when we were holding, breathing in, and exhaling. Another great component was there was a little face that would do the exercise with you and when you would inhale it would smile.

The way this app relates with anxiety and panic attacks is, I think this can be beneficial to help get our heart rates down, get us to focus on other things, and help us relax. I think this would be incredibly useful in situations of discomfort of nervousness, I know this would help me and many others. Breathing methods help center us, by doing the five breaths with the app helped me feel more in control and calm of what I was doing. I have shared this app with my family, as I know they have been going through some hard times lately and they could use something to relax and destress them. 

Stress can be hard to manage, and a lot of the talking “podcasts” seem to help with trying to get you to let go or trying to find other things to distract ourselves with so we dont become too overwhelmed. Overall, I think this app has some benefits it helps calm you, center you, and puts you at peace. It certainly helped my anxiety be more managable while doing assignments and it helped me get in the right direction for the next couple of hours with my work and overall wellness. I can definitely see myself using this in a store to distract myself from my anxiety because this type of stuff can be grounding.",5,False,Good app,kireahm22,

2023-07-17 17:34:37,"I am a teen who struggles with ADHD, Autism, Depression, and C-PTSD. I first tried this app years ago on a campaign to improve my mental health and reduce my su**idal feelings and thoughts. For the month I had this app, my mental state felt so much better. I was more present. Mindful. Genuinely feeling like I could find the strength to go on.

Fast forward 30 days, and my subscription ran out. I tried to keep the habit up on my own for a while, and succeeded at least a bit; but it just wasn’t the same. So I gave up, and saw the app as something I’d get again “one day”, when I could afford it. Losing the free version of the app made it even worse (but I don’t blame you; this company is too helpful and beneficial to people’s lives not to deserve support). I’ve found other ways to try to help my mental health and my life, but that feeling that everything would be ok that this app gave me was gone.

Then, I found out about the Peer Health Exchange program giving free membership to teenagers. I’m 18 (but honestly hardly feel older than 15, even now), and so I thought I wouldn’t be accepted—but I still tried anyway. When I got the link and realized I could finally use this app again, it literally made me happy enough to want to cry on the spot. I’m using the app again, and I couldn’t be happier about it.

2023-05-21 13:33:09,"I was fortunate enough to receive a free membership to headspace at the beginning of the pandemic. 
I was as stressed and depressed as I had ever been. My mother had just passed away and I had moved to the other side of the country where I knew no one in the six months prior to Covid. 
The generous gift of that membership brings tears to my eyes today because of the enormous impact it has had on my life.
I was so miserable. I was drinking way too much as a measure to ease some of the misery and anxiety I was feeling which, of course, only contributed to it in the long run. 
In all honesty, I had been miserable for years. Self-medicating until numb and that’s all I had really hoped for. 
Head space changed that. Meditation changed that. 
I started slow at first, as these things do. I eventually realized I was choosing not to drink because it made the meditation feel better, be more satisfying somehow. 
It wasn’t a chore to stop drinking. I gladly chose to now that I had another way to not be in so much pain. 
It was a journey that took a couple years but one I never thought I’d have the will to make. I didn’t think my emotional damage could actually be healed or that there was really any other viable way to fix it aside from self-medication. 
I have never been so grateful to be wrong. 
I now have a significantly more peaceful, satisfying life. My interests are in things that make me feel good instead of just numb. I have interests now. That feels like a life. 
I wish I had invested in meditation earlier in my life but could not be more happy to have it now.

2021-06-09 08:08:55,"Was thinking of giving it 1 star… below is why⬇️

Headspace is truly a wonderful app.
It has evolved through time with new features made for every kind of person. New high quality content is constantly added. 

I started meditation and mindfulness through Andy’s book, “Headspace Guide To Meditation and Mindfulness” and it was a game changer. Eventually I downloaded the app and, sometime after, I started paying annual membership. I do so without regret because of what the app offers. The opportunity to access guided meditation by teachers such as Andy is incredible!!  Everyday life is a fight, the world is going fast, our lives as well…for me, the app has become an necessary aide for motivation and resources. 

Precisely this is why I almost gave it 1 star. Everything is so magnificent it has generated dependency.  It is so good, that now it seems very difficult for me to meditate without it. It is as if I’ve lost my ability, will, and/or discipline to acquire headspace on my own. Makes sense? Maybe. Foreseeable? Most likely. Inevitable? Not really. Could be just me? Definitely. As of writing this comment, I will actively work to put in practice meditation and mindfulness on my own again.

My advice for anyone reading the review is to go for it. Try it out, learn the basics and reap the benefits !!!  but be careful to practice being present and dealing with your mind without having to use the app. I believe the app can’t become essential in our lives. Good luck !",5,False,Good and Bad ? 1 star or 5 stars ? 🤔,Losabesol,

2021-09-05 15:22:37,"I used Headspace just for bedtime stories for over a year, and just recently was told that the reason I’m not sleeping well is probably due to anxiety.  My husband was in a serious accident two years ago and the sudden caretaking duties were so overwhelming that I began to doubt myself in all realms of life.  My energy, mental capabilities, confidence, and low-key go with the flow attitude have still not recovered after two years.  

Despite being fairly averse to “woo woo” therapies and practices, I am a scientist (by profession and at heart) and the science behind the benefits of meditation is solid.  So I decided I should give it a try to reduce anxiety and regain some confidence and happiness.  Headspace is the only source of guided meditations I’ve found for people like me who need a down to earth entry point that’s not spiritual, mystical, or hokey in any way shape or form.  The meditations are about focusing on your breath, your body, relaxing and letting go of thoughts, and becoming more mindful (ie, able to take things in stride without flipping out) and less worried.  

I’ve gone through the ‘basics’ courses and recently discovered the ‘today’ section, which has curated set of brief videos and meditations just for each day, and even incorporated the next session of whatever course you happen to be taking- now that’s what I do every morning.  I’ve only just started, but I already feel much more calm throughout the day- I can get more done during my work day without shutting down from fear of responsibility and curling up on the couch for hours.  Headspace is giving me my life back. (Also therapy, but I get to use headspace every day!)

2023-01-15 05:01:41,"This app has saved my life. I have been using it with a membership since 2019 and have relied on it religiously over the years. I love the illustrations and videos. I am a visual learner so I appreciate how they break down numerous concepts with visual aids - it was also what first drew me to the app. I have seen the app go through a lot of changes, especially with the UI, and there is also SO much more in the app now than when I started using it. I like all of the different content available in addition to just meditation and the visual organization of everything. I have been enjoying the app’s latest update as it currently stands with a few exceptions…

1. I REALLY wish that the streak counter had a grace period. I struggle with maintaining my streak, (we all miss one day here and there) but it is very discouraging when I am finally on a long streak and miss one day and have to start over. It would be nice if there were some sort of encouraging message/reminder when you miss a day and your streak continues, but after missing 2 days it starts over. Apps like Duo-lingo are a good example of this function.

2. I wish there was a way to remove/hide courses from the daily meditations section/homepage. I don’t particularly like having 2 meditations back to back in the “start your day” section. Then if you don’t complete it, it just lingers day after day. I also bounce between courses a lot and it would be nice to have a space in the app where all of your courses are located together.

3. It would be super helpful to have a filter on the search function for meditations. That way you could search by length, type, instructor, video, activity, etc. There is SO much content now; it can be overwhelming and difficult to find what I am looking for.

4. I love the yoga section, but I have done most of them multiple times and wish there were new ones added. I feel that section is still pretty limited but I am grateful for it as a resource and would use it more if there was new content being added. 

I have been using the paid/membership version of this app for over 4 years now and while I really do love it, these are all things that I have consistently felt would be improvements and hope that the developers take into consideration.",4,False,"Long-time user, first-time reviewer",Gabg,
2022-11-18 15:14:02,"Hate new design! Used headspace couple years ago when it just came up and it was so simple and straightforward! It was all about meditation and convenience! Then I got Calm app for free for one year and did not liked it all! There is way more guidance in Headspace especially for beginners! Mediations are much better in headspace! Andy you are the best! 

When I started using this app again couple weeks ago (November 2022) it is so different! Now, its even hard to find what you want! I have this “start your day” on the main screen with checkmarks! I don't need that! Makes me look like leave things unchecked if I only do my meditation! Gives me some topics I am not interested in! Does not give me a choice to remove it or to modify my main screen. Designers and Developers nice try good job, I understand maybe you are trying to improve retention by developing habits or something else I don't know but this new start your day with checkmarks did not work for me.  I am not interested in power napping or listening to some random course on adversity, eating habits, or anxiety!

Maybe main page would look better with slots where I can keep my favorite courses: breath, continue last course, days on streaks and if I click on each one I go into details. Or if you at least give us a choice to modify it.

Liked previous simple design. Liked that in the past you did not need to go to the course info to change duration and videos would just pop in right away before certain mediation. I understand that now headspace is more than just a guided audio mediation app and you have so many courses. And have to redesign! 

Also bug alert: when closing information about mediation (at least in basics) mediation automatically starts which is quite annoying. Sometimes I want to see information about the course after the mediation and when I close it starts like “welcome back…”!

But that first month is very very difficult, you have to stick with it every day. Then after the first month or two, I found (back in 2017) that I came to enjoy meditation so much it was easy and I’d happily spend hours at it, had a 300+ day streak at one point, then foolishly thought “I’m good now right? I wonder what happens if I just stop.” You cannot. Do not do that, stopping back in 2017 is one of the things I regret most in my entire life.

Lately it seems like trying to get into it, I can’t catch a break.

Mindfulness meditation does work eventually though, I promise! And just now as I’m having a very real panic attack over some very real current events (war) that my friends & colleagues might not survive, I reached for the app and their SOS mini-meditations helped me out of that state of panic.

It’s incredibly frustrating to navigate around. My absolute favorite feature and what put headspace on the map for me in the first place is courses. Courses are meditations for usually 10 days in a row that focus on the same topic. When I was first using headspace around 10 years ago, courses were the foundation of the headspace experience and are the core of what made it unique and enjoyable compared to other meditation apps. The developers have decided to all but hide these courses, burying them under a mountain of other content I’m not interested in. The main page is a todo list of various meditations throughout the day with the vast majority being one-offs. I understand that choosing to focus on one-offs means that they are chasing the more casual user and that’s fine. But for the daily user it’s frustrating that it’s so difficult to access my favorite part of the headspace experience. Even if the front page of the app is hand curated, I could be at a very different point in my life or emotions than other users and need a different set of tools than the standard ones being presented. For an app whose goal is to increase mindfulness there is a lot of distraction and frustration.

So now when you go into soundscapes and you listen to the longer version which is 480 minutes to 500 minutes, when you go back into the app after being out (or it practically crashing because you left it for a moment), it puts you back to a 45 minute soundscape, something that you would never choose. It used to remember. Oh, and now play is pause and pause is play. Good job geniuses. Hyuk hyuk hyuk hyuk. I’ll change it back to five stars when you do what I’ve asked. Looks like now the app now crashes at ANY notification on your phone—had to give my review an update! Oh, and they keep removing all of the good features that made this app so great, I guess it’s kind of a different direction, the direction of everything else that I don’t care to pay for. There’s not even a group meditation anymore. I thought that sort of what this app was about. What am I paying for? Propaganda? Oh and now it crashes DAILY before I wake up, actually causing me BROKEN SLEEP regardless of whether or not I even have DND on!!!! Thanks for nothing, AND the censorship!!! I’m FUMING.

You should have an app that doesn’t crash, maybe instead of focusing on all the wokism culture you should focus more on the detrimental bugs that lose your business.
Latest update: I canceled my subscription. I took the update, it still crashes even if DND is on, I think regardless of whether or not I get a notification. Y’all have gone and turned it into a trash app and I’m not paying for this. Broken sleep all week. NOPE. I’d rather sleep in SILENCE. I don’t care for your woke garbage either (that there seems to be more of with each update by the way). I don’t care for the sexuality being thrown at me from all angles including meditation? I thought meditation was about clearing your mind… You can update the woke section, but you can’t keep your app from crashing with each update lol. I know where your priorities are.

As a minor I’m not aloud to pay for this, specially 70$. And before you talk about the free subscription I had tried that though it tried to get me to pay 70$ before the free subscription. It had me try and fill out a form and everything. I wasn’t okay with this specially with me being a minor who just wants to relax at the end of the day. I’m not aloud as kid to go and start paying for stuff online. If anything this is making an app that needs to be relaxing STRESSFUL. I’m kindly asking to please take this off as I just want to relax and take some deep breaths at night. And before I go why is EVERYTHING needing to be unlocked and payed for?? I get this is how you profit and get money but there has to be other ways of course. Atleast make a section of free videos, short but free. Not a couple week subscription just free overall. If you wanna get more people using your app trust me on this. Or even take the whole subscription thing down and put up a V.I.P Headspace area full of detailed and better quality videos for the people who pay for it. Though make sure you do keep a good handful of videos for the people who didn’t pay. Though other than that I love this app, but I have to delete it now as I have no use for it, I cant even use the app. So hopefully I can download it again sometime for a even better headspace.

2021-08-10 16:50:16,"I’ve had a paid headspace subscription for one year now.  For me, the meditations got really tedious after just a few months because they all follow the same basic format: the narrator gives some words of wisdom for about a minute, followed by silence and the occasional prompt, and then closing with some more dialogue from the narrator.  Every meditation was more or less about the same, regardless of what the topic was.  The “words of wisdom” were trite sayings I’ve heard a dozen times in passing from self-help gurus, yoga instructors, 12-step program people, etc, and the rest of the meditation was mostly silence.  There’s not much substance.
I’ve always thought it was crazy to leave a negative review for a meditation service because, after all, what doesn’t work for me may help others. I was planning to just cancel and be done with it but decided to leave this review based mostly on their difficult and shady cancellation policies.
You can’t cancel your subscription in the app - you have to log in to their website.  First red flag.  Good luck remembering your log-in credentials that you haven’t used for a year.  Once you’re in and you start the cancellation process, it begs you to stay: “Are you sure?”  “What if we gave you a discount?”  “How about you sleep on it?”  I had to click NO for three different prompts.  Every step of the cancellation process is designed to be a road block and to make you second-guess your decision and stay on for another year.  Once I completed the cancellation, it logged me out without any confirmation.  When I logged back in, the website still said I have an active subscription.

2021-02-08 16:19:05,"Headspace is a great supplemental tool to use if you’re looking for emotional and physical well-being whether you’re having a typical bad day, you’re having trouble sleeping, or you’re having a major life crisis. Of course it’s not a cure-all, but I’d definitely say it’s a help-all. It’s helped me in managing anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, grief, loneliness, being over-excited for events, ect. It’s even been of one the tools I use to calm my mind and help prevent migraines if I feel a small one coming on. 

Personal experiences:

One night, back when I was pregnant, I was panicking from the grief of my mother dying of brain cancer, and that night I felt I could barely walk because of the overwhelming emotions I was having, but prayer and headspace helped me calm myself enough to function again that night. 

When I moved to a city after living my whole life in rural areas, headspace and prayer were what helped me overcome the feelings of being trapped and anxious. I started out with the free trial which was great. Then I was gifted the premium and I enjoyed that, though I wish it was always free ;). I’m back to the basics now, and it is still helpful.

Overall, headspace has helped me calm down on a regular basis to levels I didn’t think were possible for me. Headspace along with counseling have led the way for me to overcome negative thought patterns I’ve had my whole life. 

Headspace has taught me mindfulness meditation and helped me accept myself and appreciate my present reality. These techniques has showed me how to be as calm and clear headed as God intended when he created our bodies and minds to have those calming mechanisms such as deep breathing and visualizations already built in. Headspace can just help you discover those. 

Headspace changed the way I help myself and my children cope with strong emotions. It’s helped me be more present and grounded in my own life, and that’s huge for me. Thanks, headspace.",5,False,"If you’re overwhelmed, Headspace can probably help",A girl in her 20's,

2022-10-21 12:22:26,"Update:  Nine months in, I wanted to provide a few updated thoughts.  The content is impressive and varied.  There is something for everyone.  The variety of instructors allows you to explore different styles and voices.  They are all outstanding in their own ways.  We’ll done.  

On the down side, the organization of the app is poor.  The only way to bookmark something to explore at a later time is to add it to the favorites list, which defeats the purpose of a favorites list.  And getting to the downloads is a layered process.  They should be accessible from the home page. One click away.  

 Also, It would be nice to be able to guide  what goes into the daily feed.  Often I find the content “selected” for me is more suited to a teenager or young adult who is new to meditation.  I’m 72 and have been an on and off practitioner for years.  The advanced classes I’m working on rarely show up on the home screen, while all the intro to meditation and combating teen angst does.

Also, I’m finding that since Andy’s departure, some of the new content is geared toward activism instead of mindfulness.  Instead of sitting on the side of the road passively observing the traffic, it’s now about jumping into the traffic to stop the cars.  Consequently I’m exploring other programs and am undecided if I’ll renew my yearly Headspace membership in January.  

Original 5 Star review February 2022:   This is a great introduction to guided meditation and mindfulness. I’ve been an on and off “practitioner” of meditation since the mid 1980s, when I lived in Thailand, but I recently felt the need to recenter and refocus. A few months ago I came across a Headspace introduction on Netflix and was so impressed by its clarity and simplicity that I now have the app and a years subscription.

2023-04-30 12:54:47,"Revised: I have experienced over 1100 meditation sessions on this app; ideally, I use it twice a day. My reason for being here, is to mediate.

The app does contain incredible sessions and the meditation process does work. Previous editions of this app had a different intention and overall appearance, before Headspace merged with Ginger, before Andy and Rich stepped away, before, it became Headspace Health. The current intent of the app is beyond meditation, so it’s marketed and organized, in that way.

On organization, this app was more direct and efficient at the beginning of 2022, that is, if you want to go beyond the first opening page.

It takes more scrolling and searching to find previous content, than it did in February 2022. I find all of this to be chaos. Given the price of this app it should be less confusing.

The app pushes diversity to connect the universal experience of meditation; if you want a sampling of instructors, you can find that under beginning meditation. If you have been meditating with Andy Puddicombe, his name is not listed in the same way. Right now, I have chosen to stay with Andy, I supplement that with other content beyond this app.

The Netflix series, Guide to Meditation, my first Headspace experience, was beautifully created; I was in awe of the innovative visualizations. I highly applaud Netflix for talking the risk to visually tackle this topic. I loved the Netflix imagery and felt instantly at ease with Andy, as my guide. I accepted this figurative animation as my mentor; I never though about his race or gender.
On Headspace, Netflix: Bravo!!!

 I have watched Andy Puddicombe’s TedTalk, and have read his book. I’ve listened to online videos of his thoughts, as well.

I do like the pace and format of his meditation style; he is easy to understand, and speaks clearly in English; I mention only this because online meditations from other non-western countries are often, not crisp, and I miss words.

Andy is both straightforward and empathetic, compassionate and disciplined; he comprehends difficult emotions and is articulate. Andy has a natural gift for training, to communicate, and, for having patience. He understands this amazing balance between the mind and body. It’s a tightrope act and following him, as a guide, helps me to stay on focus.

The ability to speak this see-saw, between thinking and feeling, between the mind and body, between opposing forces, is a gift. His gift.

I do think so highly of Andy, I have chosen to have him as my Headspace mentor; his meditations are a 10+, on a scale of 1-5.

Non-the-less, it doesn’t why you are here.

The effect and peace of mind/body is worth the app price, but this place is a disaster. It contains too many links, to the same content.

We genuinely appreciate your candor. To start, our intent behind the collaboration with Disney and Star Wars was meant to help reach new audiences, to help further demystify meditation for new and current members, and to hopefully expand on the unstuffy, approachable content that our members love and appreciate. We are, however, so sorry to hear that you're not a fan of this collaboration. \n\nOur goal at Headspace has always been to reach as many people as we can with the tools to help live healthier and happier lives. Our intention is not to stray away from what makes Headspace so special and unique. If anything, our hope is to continue offering a variety of beneficial content and topic areas to help our members find mindfulness in all areas of their lives.\n\nTo answer your question more specifically around Andy - he has been on a gradual journey over the past two years to step back a bit, to refocus his efforts on philanthropy, family and other endeavors. He only stepped back recently, however, after dedicating years to recording timeless meditations and content that are designed to guide you on your meditation journey for years to come. Andy's insight, guidance, wisdom and teachings are foundational to the Headspace experience. \n\nBut, we value you as a member of Headspace and I really take to heart your thoughts and feedback. I do hope that you can continue to seek out Headspace as a supportive tool in your life. \n\nThank you, again, for sharing your thoughts. I’m not sure if this response will make you feel better. But, I’m hoping it at least helps provide some clarity.\xa0 If you have any additional thoughts or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to help@headspace.com."", 'modified': '2022-05-23T15:28:43Z'}"

2023-01-02 12:16:01,"This app contains a wide variety of meditations for all sorts of goals (rest, presence, wakefulness, dealing with change, etc.). But it has three major pain points that grate on my nerves each time I use it:
1. There’s no end bell or gong for completing a meditation. Sometimes I’ll do a wake-up meditation and keep sitting, listening for more narration minutes after the meditation has actually completed. I’d love the option to toggle on/off a gentle bell so I know the audio is over. (Then to disable it for sleep meditations where I don’t want to be woken back up.) Not all mediations have guided music or sound, so a bell would make it really clear that my session was over.
2. A PLAYLIST FEATURE. Oh my goodness it’s so frustrating to me that at night, I have to play either a wind down or an 8 hour night sound (such as rain, waves, etc.). I desperately wish that there was an option to create a nighttime playlist of a narrated wind down followed by 8 hours of rain, one flowing into the other without my interference. I could ditch my sound machine if this was a feature, which I really want to do.
3. No dislike option for meditations. I love the heart option, as it helps me remember and easily find meditations I like, but there’s no “do not show this meditation again” option. There are some audio voices I don’t like hearing and some nature sounds that are unpleasant to my ears and I’d love to better curate what’s displayed to me based on what I like and dislike. Having a reliable set of go-to favorites with no grating sounds/voices would be a real treat.

2021-11-21 15:45:57,"I have been a Headspace user for several years now. I first found it back in 2016 after I graduated from college, I could only periodically afford to keep the app as expenses had been a challenge. But I always came back. Headspace has provided me with the resources and support I needed from a community. The approach to everyday practice is made so simple that I would practice on my own throughout the day. 

However, in the last year or so the app has become chaotic and monotonous. There are pop ups when I open the app to suggest new material -which feels like ads (triggering stress). The suggested material on the Today page is not customizable and not relatable. I’d be okay with one suggestion, but 6 is too much. In addition, every page you choose is advertising a meditation, rather than letting you explore. 

The app is saturated with advertising itself. People are burnt out on having things sold to them. I’m amazed that the app I once bragged about has lost its focus. What happened to the supportive community I once enjoyed connecting with?

Older meditations done by Andy created a sense of accomplishment, development of practice, and realistic changes. The practices were more diverse and engaging. 

Now, the meditations all sound exactly the same and most of the material is over crowding the app. I do not enjoy exploring the new content like I used to. 

Starting to think I will need to end my subscription after almost 5 years.

Very sad and disappointed. I hope Headspace realizes there app has lost its vision and has become messy and dull.",2,False,Became Dissapointing,lemonnoone,

2022-01-05 16:29:06,"I have been a subscriber to Headspace for quite a while now but am planning on finding a different app due to recent “politically correct” content that I find inappropriate and offensive. 

Martin Luther King Jr. famously hoped that his children “would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” In contrast, it would appear that Headspace has now jumped on the “woke” bandwagon that EMPHASIZES  skin color, offering a platform to those who favor “people of color” over “privileged” white people.

In particular, I’m referring to “Rachel” and her “Acknowledging Our Privilege” so-called meditation. Instead of focusing on gratitude, acceptance, kindness, and how much we humans have in common, this woman is negative and divisive, ruminating about those who have privilege and those who don’t. She apparently craves a utopia in which we all happily end up at her “finish line” simultaneously. Anything less is the fault of “privilege.” And, in the midst of this thinly veiled rant, she admiringly quotes a member of Black Lives Matter, a self-avowed Marxist organization that is anti-white and anti-Semitic.

My “privilege” has also included heartache and hardship, and only 80 years ago my people were tortured and murdered in the worst genocide in this planet’s history. Instead of stereotyping individuals as disadvantaged vs. privileged, Rachel might want to meditate about her own intolerance and racism. I will not be made to feel guilty or ashamed because I happen to be white, and I resent bringing identity politics into what is supposed to be a positive, helpful app, not a fixation on victimhood and unfairness.",3,True,Don’t like politics creeping into a meditation app,Debbie1231,"{'id': 27130304, 'body': 'We truly do apologize for your experience.

2021-03-11 14:17:37,"I should have reviewed this app years ago. 5 stars for sure. I’ve recommended it to so many friends and have given it as a gift many times as well.   

I took a hiatus much of this last crazy year (ironically when I prob needed it the most) and when I recently came back, I see the total redesign with a ton of new content. So now we are scrolling through all this content, tons of media, noise, and suggested to set a myriad of notifications?!  Is this conducive to a quiet mind? No. In fact, every time I open the app I end up feeling super anxious.  I thought it was a one off, but it’s happened each time. It’s too much noise and it’s too chaotic at the time in the morning when I’m trying to start my day off right by focusing on presence, quieting the mind, and setting my intentions before leaping into my crazy day.  Now, instead of being a respite, a place for grounding, this app mirrors much of what life looks like these days and all social media apps.  Honestly, this really feels like Headspace “sold out.”

Once you dig around and find what you’re looking for, Andy’s soothing guided meditations are still there, and I do love the ambient noise and low-fi tracks that have been added. I get it. You’re trying to corner the market on all things zen. Gotcha. There’s a BD team making very different decisions than our beloved yogis and zen masters. So....

In the spirit of both staying true to the mission AND in consumer satisfaction (which is of course, good business) I will offer the perfect solution, instead of canceling my membership (yet) bc Andy is the best. Create a customizable home page. Let me drag over only the things I want on my page.  It would be what I see when I open the app and no need to navigate elsewhere if I don’t want to.  I would personally choose to keep it uncluttered and super simple with my mediations and maybe some music. Others may do something diff. To each their own.   And when I’m not in mediation mode, maybe then I’ll choose to dig around the other media and content to check out your new stuff, and drag and drop new favorites to my page.  But opening this app and seeing this chaotic stream of content is not sustainable for me, and I cannot imagine that I am alone in that.",2,False,Have loved for years but not the new 2.0 version,D in NYC ,"{'id': 21637993, 'body': ""Thank you for your feedback and we're sorry for any trouble navigating the app. If you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to our team at help@headspace.com.

2021-12-14 15:16:40,"I first downloaded Headspace in 2017. It was recommended to me by a friend after I opened up to her about having recurring episodes of anxiety and she told me to try guided meditation as it was helping her. 

So I downloaded it, tried it, and found that it helped me so much. Meditation quickly became part of my evening routine. Shower, brush teeth, get into bed, open up headspace, and meditate. 

Headspace has helped me to find the inner peace of my mind in the midst of turmoil. To always remember that blue sky. I would do the free guided meditations over and over, and I believe I have racked up about 3,000 + total hours of meditation. I would do the 5 minute mediations on my lunch breaks and the 10 minute ones at home. It helped me so much with my anxiety and overall helped quiet down my chaotic thoughts that were relentlessly swirling through my mind. 

I put my friends onto the Headspace app and told them that they could just do the free guided mediations over and over the same way I did. I posted the app to my instagram story and told my followers the same thing. 

This morning I logged onto the app and clicked on “Basics” and was met with a “start your free trial” button. Confused, I went back to the menu and clicked it again. Same thing. I saw the lock icon next to the Basics and slowly realized that the app I used for the past 4 years to help manage my anxiety was no longer free and I couldn’t do the free guided courses anymore that I was so used to.

 This app that saved me in so many hard times, that helped regulate my mind and calm me down when I was feeling anxious, I could no longer access. I felt betrayed. I feel like this app that I cared so much for no longer cares about me, or maybe never even did. Something that is supposed to help people with their mental health is no longer accessible to those who cannot afford it. 

I’m not just disappointed, but I’m upset, confused, infuriated, anxious, and I just want to be able to meditate again with the sound of Dora’s voice guiding me in the background.

2023-09-20 15:08:05,"I’m sure many people are going to see the title of this review, and scoff. But just hear it out, and then maybe scoff afterwards. But, I started my headspace journey all the way back in 2019. I was in a very abusive situation, and in a bad moment, instead of spiraling, I reached out to a friend, asking for help. She was immediately there for me, suggesting I download an app called “calm harm”. It either didn’t exist on android, or I couldn’t get it. First on the list was “Calm” which I hadn’t really resonated with. Under it, was Headspace. The initial design drew me in, so I downloaded it, and immediately went into the 3 Minute Basics. I remember I had done a few back-to-back in that moment, because I didn’t wanna feel how I felt anymore. 2019 ended up almost being one of the best years of my life because of headspace. The world was so tough, and I was so exhausted. But I had headspace, and it’s practices when it did get too overwhelming. Now, unfortunately after about 9 months I fell back into that abusive situation, due to my own doing. And I lost all progress thinking I had it all figured out. But, about a month later, after wasting money, and not eating for two days due to stress. I’d had enough. I focused on me again, after being out of the situation I put myself in. And while it wasn’t as consistent as it was before, it was at least something. And when you can’t afford help, or, you are like how I was and didn’t want it at the time, you should at least start somewhere. And if I hadn’t, I know I wouldn’t be where I am mentally without them. I still struggle, simply because there are times I feel like I don’t deserve to, that I should sit with my anxious and sad self, because why not? But then I come back every time. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll get back to where I was. And you will, too <3",5,False,Life Changing.,sweett pea,

2023-09-15 06:19:59,"I have used Headspace over the years and have thoroughly enjoyed everything that this app offers. There are a plethora of topics and resources on here that I am so happy are available to people who are either new to meditation or have been practicing for years. Meditation is one of the most effective tools and ways of reshaping/healing your brain. Personally, I have learned a lot from Headspace and meditation in general which I am so grateful for. It has been a few years since I have used the app, so I recently redownloaded it. 

Unfortunately, I have been noticing the uprise of subscription based apps. Especially for mental health or self-help apps. I am extremely disappointed that the price of a monthly subscription for this wonderful resource is quite expensive. I remember years ago, there was an option for a membership but they still had a wide variety of free meditations… 

I do not really see the point to having the app if you are not going to pay. There is nothing that is unlocked besides the courses: finding focus, letting go of stress and managing anxiety. (Also the “how to headspace” is unlocked). This is very disappointing and though there are three *actually* free courses, I feel this falls short to selling a subscription. Sure, there’s a 7 day free trial, but there are many out there who cannot afford a monthly or yearly payment for a membership. Additionally, 7 days isn’t a long time to learn about meditation or even develop a habit of practicing (mainly for those who are newer to meditating, I am NOT talking about people who are experienced). At least have the basics unlocked so that people who may not be able to afford a membership can access the great help and tools that this app offers to begin on their journey of meditation.

I am unable to afford this subscription, therefore I will look to other apps or even Youtube at this point.

2023-09-14 19:58:41,"I found that using Headspace the way it’s set up to guide you through the day has been a huge waste of my time. I spend an inordinate amount of time going from one mini tutorial & meditation to the next, over & over again. Instead of going from one mini-tutorial-meditation to another and having to do the beginning breathing exercises repeatedly, wouldn’t it be more time efficient & helpful to a beginner meditator to do one longer breathing-tutorial-meditation ? You could conceivably begin with a 15 minute meditation & go on to 2 hours or more, according to the needs of the user. All of the other psychological tutorials and talks are fine, & I have benefited from one or two. But you need to do more than you have with meditation for those of us who have come to you for that purpose. Many are using meditation to get closer to God. We would like to learn more than one type of meditation practice because each kind of meditation has its own unique purpose. We would like to meditate with spiritual music & have it counted in daily statistics as a meditation along with meditating with your nature sounds. Personally, I love to meditate with the sound of wind for an hour or more. But according to your statistics, I haven’t meditated since July. I will be leaving Headspace for now, but I will return every year or so to see if you have added any of these ideas. I have always been able to meditate on YouTube with its variety of meditation styles. And with a membership that doesn’t break the bank. I was hoping that an app could help me to find what I’m looking for, but after having tried at least 30 or more meditation apps, I don’t think that our society is there yet. The closest I have come to finding a more spiritual app was in InsightTimer. But the organization was appalling last I was on it & then they changed it & I couldn’t find anything anymore. It’s a big job developing a meditation app that can be used by a wide variety of people. And from my experience, no one has been successful as yet. Good luck Headspace.

2023-03-22 07:48:36,"Headspace literally changed my life and I am, no joke, actually crying while writing this… though I also ate a yummy dinner of 🍄🍋 lol… but all that ✨ aside, doesn’t change the fact that Headspace has made me a better person since I first joined in 2018.

I have been a paying member since 2019, starting with monthly but quickly opting for an annual membership. When 2020 rolled around and Covid-19 struck, Headspace put out a ton of content specific to the struggles related to the pandemic, they granted free access to more paid content, and they even offered a complimentary annual pass for those experiencing financial hardship due to the pandemic. IMO that says a lot about a company.

In that time, I have completed 2453 sessions of an average length of 37 minutes. 

I had a 600+ day streak that was only broken because I was on my sick bed with Covid and completely out of it for 24+ hours. I currently have a 257 day streak.

I have meditated with the app for a total of 91,614 minutes. That’s 1526.9 hours, 63.62 mfing days, or 0.1743 YEARS. And that number only tracks meditation minutes, it doesn’t take into account the countless hours of other outstanding content (like their exercise videos, podcasts, some music playlists, sleepcasts [one of my favs, think grown-up bedtime stories, but incredibly descriptive to the point of being almost immersive at times], etc.). 

Thanks to the good habits Headspace has helped me develop — like a daily meditation practice, combined with greater mindfulness during day-today moments, and break many bad ones — like alcoholism and prescription drug addiction, disordered eating, intrusive thoughts of suicide.

I am a better, happier person. I am a better parent and spouse and all-around general human. 

I would subscribe to a lifetime membership if they had one. This app is worth every penny.

I found your site & immediately joined your group. Although my journey began SO RECENTLY, I am surprised to see a gradual, positive change! 
As cynical as I have become about the archaic approaches of traditional Medicine “treating” patients like me, with greed being a primary goal &/or secondary gain, that is a major compliment to you. ⭐️The more physicians have to lose, the less likely they are to embrace the science which clearly demonstrates that mindfulness & meditation practices can relieve and eventually cure chronic pain.⭐️
I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on 7 back surgeries for fusions which failed, injections monthly for years,  opioids, chiropractic, acupuncture & countless “healers”, many of whom were charlatans. The tragedy is when the opioid hysteria began, meds ( my ONLY relief) were abruptly withdrawn, leaving patients like me with no skills to manage pain & NO quality of life.
However, I believe that this “Opioid Hysteria”may be the answer to many years of prayer.

It is nothing short of a MIRACLE that I saw those 2 lectures on YouTube during which a famous Pain Scientist & Physical Therapist made references to you. Having two masters degrees in the health profession, those two lectures really got my attention.
Headspace, along with educating myself on all the science which clearly demonstrates actual changes in the brains of patients who assume meditation practices, is giving me hope after almost 2 decades of suffering.

2022-01-26 16:22:03,"I’m giving Headspace one star for a couple of reasons:
1.)  A misleading pricing and discount scheme. 
2.)  The content is repetitive and misleadingly displayed, especially when one considers the scammy pricing tactics. 
3.)  Poor customer service. 

1.) Headspace “costs” 70 dollars a year.   They give you a trial period that’s long enough to get a survey of the interface and maybe see some of the benefits of a mindfulness meditation practice. Once the trial ends, they bombard you with emails asking to purchase a year of access. 

DON’T be like me and pay full price. Wanna know why?  They WILL start to send you a series of coupon codes. The discounts they will send you will increase until you get a coupon code for about half off. Wait until then, because the lowest price Headspace will offer you ($35-40) is the absolute the MOST this app is worth. 

2.) The app presents mediations in a way that makes them appear diverse and covering a wide array of challenges. Titles such as “Coping with Cravings” or “Returning to School” or “Losing a Job” look to cover a diverse array of topics. You might think that a diverse array of topics involve a diverse array of techniques:  you would be wrong. 

Headspace repackages the same two mediations with different titles to make the amount of content feel larger. Even with different mediation guides, the content boils in the majority down to two types: guided mindful breathing and a “sun light” visualization. You better like these two because if you use a year membership regularly it WILL get repetitive and you WILL realize that you paid money for what is, mostly, the same content repeated over and over with the thirty second intro and outro changed. 

For me the sunlight visualization doesn’t work AT ALL and before halfway through a year of my subscription I kept trying “new” meditation courses only to discover they were the same mediations I’d been doing for months. This is when I realized I paid too much and got “soft scammed” by the pricing structure. 

3.)  Headspace asked for feedback and I raised these issues. I told them their pricing felt exploitative and scammy, and that their content was repetitive and not worth what I paid. They “appreciated” my comments but failed to offer any real fix. No partial refund for the 6 months of subscription I didn’t use. They offered me a year free, which would reflect that I paid the MOST this app is worth ($35 a year). 

Maybe if they gave me lifetime access my $70 would have been worth it. 
The MOST a year should cost is $35, it really should be $20.

2022-01-23 05:02:24,"There are some great resources about mindfulness that can help you that don’t require a monthly subscription. John Kabat-Zinn has good content if you like reading. If you have audible you can get “the science of mindfulness” — I highly recommend it as someone who took a therapeutic mindfulness class in grad school. It goes into why mindfulness matters and HOW it changes your brain and promotes wellbeing with regular practice, and different ways of doing it. The lecturer of the course has a website with FREE guided meditations that I believe are better than what this app offered at the time I had my free trial. Mindfulness-solution.com. More FREE guided meditations on self-compassion are on Kristin Neff’s website self-compassion.org.

The headspace app is great for people who have money to burn and want everything in a nice tidy package, but it is limited.

I wanted to give Headspace a try and see if that could help me practice mindfulness as well as help me relax. I used the free trial to start and I have to say the UI is beautiful, the videos themselves are helpful and very well-made. My biggest complaint is how overpriced the subscription is. It is just too much money to spend every month or year for just one meditation app. Per month it is $12.99 and the annual price it is $69.99. That is basically as much as I pay for the usual streaming services that offer live tv, shows, movies, and sports. Unfortunately, I do not see the value in paying that much money for just one application on my phone. I think it is wrong that Headspace charges that much when there are people who are suffering everyday that are in need of relief, but they have to deal with a very large paywall to get there. I am not saying this application should be entirely free; however, that does not give this company the right to overcharge and take advantage of hurting people so that they can make a large profit.

2021-08-10 04:04:30,"Hello! I am around 9-15 years old (don’t want to give anyone my exact age) I have ADHD and I also deal with a lot of stress and anxiety and depression in my life. I have no idea what is triggering my stress to lead to anxiety, which also leads to me feeling depressed about myself. I loose my temper very easily, I can’t focus in class and loose all the important details my teacher is saying and when I get called on to answer a question, I don’t know what to say and it is really embarrassing. I feel life people are talking about me behind my back, I feel like I’m the one who always gets rejected. I feel like people are nice to me just to get me to shut up and walk away. I feel like I’m not wanted. I feel like I’m falling into an endless hole of nothing.   
      When my mom got a new job and her insurance changed, the insurance company said that they’ll make an exception to my doctor, but they said she needed to call the doctors office to verify that I am a current patient. So she called the doctor’s office. (And the girl that talked to her- I can’t even use the word I want to describe her) Anyways, when my mom called, the person at the front desk was supposed call the insurance company, but the girl said NO! The rest is kind of a long story and I can’t remember much, so I’ll move on to the ending of the phone call. And by the way, my mom cal almost YELLING to that girl that I cannot go off my meds. (also because they get into my immune system and don’t work anymore) Then she hung up on the girl. So I’m pretty sure I’m stuck without a doctor 😭 That did not help any. 
      Before I go to bed, I take my bedtime meds, usually to make me tired. But there’s always something on my mind that always keeps me awake, and usually what I do what I can’t sleep is think myself to sleep, and that takes about 25-40 minutes. And when I have a mindfulness story CD playing, it’s hard to ignore my thoughts and it feels like the CD doesn’t help anything. When I’m at my grandma’s house, I play guitar music and pretend I’m with my friends and having a good time in Hawaii. (Don’t question it, that’s how I am lol 😂) I pretend I’m in Hawaii because that’s my happy place and I wanna go there again someday 🥺. Then there’s my friends that keep me company because then I’m lonely. But after a while, I get that anxiety again. Like where my phone might go off in the night, like emergency alerts, calls, WhatsApp notifications (I have a friend that lives in Dubai and we have a 9 hour time difference). And I get that anxiety even when I turn my volume off, turn on do not disturb, turn on silent mode, and turn on airplane mode. I guess I’m more nervous about the emergency alerts because of the horrible noise it makes.
     When I try to go to sleep, I usually think of how my day went. But other than that, I think of all the bad stuff that might happen to me for some reason. I feel like someone’s watching me. (I gotta stop watching those Life of Luxury videos on YouTube even though they’re pretty good and funny at the same time.) When I’m scared, I usually recite the Lord’s Prayer. That usually helps.
     I didn’t really know how to do many mindful exercises, other than the breathe in and hold and breathe out one. And when I first saw the ad for this, I payed attention. I felt like something was telling me I needed the help with this mindfulness thing. I actually just got this and I have a good feeling about it. I am hoping to see a better view of myself and sleep better and most importantly, think mindfully. Thank you 😊

2021-03-11 16:23:40,"I have tried the free features of this app in the past, I follow the Podcast on Spotify and I have no doubt that headspace is great, but the motivation to leave this poor review -temporarily I hope- comes from a different aspect of my experience.

Today, just about 6 minutes ago, I finished a 3-minute session and after being seduced by the “start your free trial button” I decided to go for it and test the premium features for a while. What I didn’t know is that It was going to charge me immediately for a “free trial”?

I love the app, I appreciate Andy’s vision and the hardworking team behind every aspect of this ecosystem, but I am disappointed that I was charge a whole “anual subscription” and being honest, I am more stressed than before I even started the free 3-minute session.

I see no button to contact support. I find no space where I could solve this situation and It would mean a lot to me If I could be refunded. 

I was planning on writing a different review after trying the premium features and few minutes after, a sudden twist and here we are. How could I enjoy my free trial when I didn’t get what the “CTA button” didn’t delivered what it promised?

The offerings on meditation have also increased as well as sounds for sleep that I have used many times. My only beef with Headspace is they had me on auto renew for $99 a month. I did not know that until the charge came through on my Amex. What made it worse is while on YouTube unrelatedly I saw a new customer discount with all the bells and whistles for about half what I paid. I took a picture, contacted them and never got a straight answer. I know it’s common practice for SaaS products to offer discounts to new customers, but they should honor the price if an existing customer sees it.

2021-02-10 20:43:54,"I started using Headspace in 2014, which was a great entry point into meditation for a total beginner. 

I stopped using it in 2017 for financial reasons but came back to it because I think it beats out the other free meditation apps due to the consistent quality of the meditations and the guided courses (without courses I ended up barely meditating anymore).

My only qualm is the new app interface/experience. I don’t know when it changed but it’s a lot more content-heavy and kind of confusing to navigate. I liked the simplicity of the old app (2014-2017 version I suppose). It also just feels like a different vibe a bit with all the social justicia content throughout, not really what I’d associate a meditation app with.

All in all, still a great app but hope it doesn’t get too detached from what it started as, a simple meditation app.",4,False,"Overall, a Great App for Meditation",Lemi112790,

When I started I had no idea what meditation was about.Headspace has guided me from the basics to the more advance techniques of meditation which has given me a new perspective on life.

If you pay a year in full the price goes down to $5.99 a month. It’s more reasonable but I don’t want to pay a year in full. Even then, it’s pricy
