2023-11-04 07:16:20,,I spoke to 6 guys over the course of 30 minutes. I was married for 5 years and started my divorce 3 years ago. I knew I had gotten too comfortable alone the last 2 years. Friends and coworkers suggested that I should get out there and that I’d gotten too comfortable being alone. This man was the only one to have normal conversation with me and so I had immediately gotten his Snapchat and phone number. Me being the nervous wreck I was started downing liquid courage and next thing I knew I was messaging him like a booty call……I ghosted him for 4 days after that night. When he messaged for a 3rd time I apologized from the bottom of my heart and let him know my over sharing and rushing into it scared me and he completely understood. Fast forward 8 months from there and I’m happier that ever. We’ve never had an argument not even in the slightest hand on the Bible. I’m so glad I gave love a chance again. I know even if this fails it was still both a blessing and a lesson. I don’t deserve the amazing man I was blessed with and he is nothing like anyone I’ve met. I hope I’ve found my someone and i hope the same for you. I was hesitant about online dating but now I’m so glad I did. Take the chance.

I was a premium member, it also doesn’t stop your membership. So despite my account being banned for an unknown amount of time, I have still been charged for the membership. They gave me no other notice that my account was banned or even under investigation other than when I tried to sign in again, so I have no way of knowing.

I've never harassed anyone or pursued anyone beyond a clear ignoring of a message or unmatch. Not was my profile spam or fake in any way. I was instructed by the generic automated email when I reached out and all I was told is that I ""violated the user agreement or terms of use"" or something along those lines. When I checked those terms, there was not one thing that could be remotely close to any term that I've broken that l've done in the years of using the app. And when I replied back with elaboration, there was, of course, no response.

2022-05-28 15:04:00,,"I used to unironically like Tinder, even at its base form I’ve gotten matches that ended up leading to great relationships. Unfortunately, as time has passed the company has made taken away features and slowly asked for more money to unlock them; specifically with super likes. 
     I’ve travelled alot and used tinder gold each time I travelled to find friends in new countries. Having five super likes a day helped me stand out from the crowd and led to fairly consistent matches. Even on a base account having access to the occasional super like was a huge help. 
     Nowadays on a base tinder account you don’t have any super likes which is genuinely a huge detriment, and on tinder gold you get five a week. A massive decrease of 35 a week to 5. But the price remained the same???
     A super like was a fantastic way to differentiate yourself in an environment where first impressions are everything. And for some guys and gals who are great people but not super models it can help hedge your bets to match with people you have a genuine interest with. I think taking that tool to consistently show interest in people you genuinely like was a bad decision for the company.

What used to be a brilliantly simple and effective dating app has turned into a frustrating, convoluted, pay-walled mess. For Tinder to be even remotely useful, you have to pay for it. And once you do, you’re allowed features that are literally free on other apps. Wanna see who likes you? You’re going to have to pay more a month than you do on a Netflix subscription for that. Btw, Hinge does that for free. Wanna leave a comment on someone’s picture? Surely you can do that with the Gold membership, right? Nope. Gotta shell out even more money for ~platinum~. Guess who also does it for free? You got it. Hinge (and I think OKC too).

2023-08-02 16:51:27,,"Honestly, Tinder has come a long way since I last tried using it. That might not be to everyone’s liking, but as someone hoping to find people to go out with and possibly develop a relationship with, I think it’s pretty good. At this point, Tinder feels like a decent mix of speedy swiping but with enough substance in a profile to get some sort of measure of the person beyond looks - when people bother to fill out their bio anyhow. Obviously it’s far from perfect but dating apps in general are probably a flawed concept. Probably half of the functionality is meant to make things difficult so that you give in and pay the rather significant subscription fees. 

One pretty specific complaint that I have is that with the subscription comes the ability to send people messages along with the “Super Like” feature. I honestly think that should be available in general without the need to pay. Could just limit the amount a person can do it. I also think it should be something you can do on profiles you’ve already swiped on.

I swiped right on this adorable, tall, guitar playing guy and we immediately matched (yay). He texted me first and we hit it off straight away. Turns out him and I went to the same college and everything. We had SOOO much in common. After getting my phone number and facetiming for a couple days, he picked me up and we went on our first date, which would be one of many many wonderful dates.

I used tinder to make friends and partners, and be able to meet them. I used the app for multiple years and even spent a lot of money on it. But the reason my rating is low is because the feeling i have right now. Recently, i'd been getting pop ups that made me redo the same test over and over to prove i'm human. And then when I went to get on today and respond to someone I was going to meet, it said I was banned. I get there are a lot of bot accounts and whatnot. But I've been loyally using tinder for years and wanted to keep doing so. There should be an appeal of some sort. Adapting a ""you're banned no matter what"" stance is unfair to your consumers. If it has happened to me, I can only imagine who else has dealt with. I, nor anyone else, went through the loops and holes to pay or get verified just to be banned out of nowhere.

In the earlier days, tinder gold bought you the most basic upgrades, like unlimited swipes. Nothing special. Today however, they’ve gotten so greedy that they made two separate algorithms: if you’ve payed for tinder gold, you’re placed in an algorithm that will match you frequently with people who swiped right on your profile. If you didn’t pay, then you are enrolled in an algorithm that purposely avoids people who’ve swiped right on your profile. Furthermore, I’ve both the free version of tinder, and I’ve used tinder gold, and I’ve found that disgustingly, you find more minorities and people people with a larger body size tend to appear significantly more frequently on the free tinder algorithm.

2022-07-03 16:58:45,,"My complaints with tinder primarily fall into two categories: auto-moderation and the gender ratio. 

Moderation is automated, with profiles being banned automatically after receiving *any* three reports, regardless of their validity or content. This is a common way to cut costs that is known to be easily exploitable by users. Men and women maliciously false report each other for rejection or not replying fast enough, leading to automated bans that cannot be contested. You can find videos of so-called “pickup artists” getting women banned after exchanging phone numbers so there will be less competition for her attention. I personally was banned after not replying to women for two weeks; several of them falsely reported me out of revenge and tinder support refuses to review the situation.  

Tinder’s male-to-female ratio is notoriously poor, in some regions being as bad as 9-to-1 according to one study. This leads to unhappiness for everyone, as women are spammed and men are ignored. To give the impression of there being more women, tinder ignores your search preferences and shows you women far outside of your age and geographic ranges. I do not want to date 18 year olds, they cannot hold a conversation. If you want to see women no less than X years old, you must set your minimum age to X+3 in my experience. This is clearly not a bug.",1,False,Shady practices and easily exploited moderation,Robert MacTenj

Tinder used to be a simple app - fast loading, easy to use, worth paying the cheap price for premium. It was perfect 5 years ago.

But you can’t control if you swipe on people genuinely local, or those using passport “pretending” to be local actually 8k miles away. So now, 19/20 swipes are from random profiles around the world. Different languages, countries, with high language barrier and zero intention to come to your area. It has completely ruined the entire experience and made it impossible to use tinder for what it was created to do — get to know people around you to find a partner / friends.

It seems like tinder has a very flawed system in which it bans whoever it likes without giving any warning or notifications on why you were banned. This is an abuse of power right here from an app that has too much power. You can’t even appeal the reason why you were banned. It just doesn’t make sense to me. I’ve had my profile since 2015. I have deleted it every now and then to take a break from it. But redownloading it recently and have been using it for the past week, everything was fine. Until today, this afternoon I went onto the app to find out I was banned.
If this is how Tinder works and does things, by asking for personal information, wanting a bio and having you do so much to make a profile, just seems like a huge breach of privacy and an abuse of power.

When you do, you discover that the likes you got were either scammers, people not in your area, or people you wouldn’t have matched with anyway.

And with the ban being pretty much permanent (as Tinder has no appeals process at the moment), I gotta say, sounds like a pretty good way to decrease user count when I think the success of an app probably depends greatly on having many satisfied people using your app? I hope developers are considering this and are AT LEAST trying to implement a formal appeals process. Even an e-mail explaining what particularly caused the ban would be better than the nothing myself and others have received. I would have liked a chance to at least address what it was Tinder thinks I’m doing wrong. This is a pretty big deterrent from my wanting to use the app again in the future when possible or recommend it to others.

Other than almost constant crashing (and the ban of course), I found the simplicity and easy use of Tinder appealing.

And that’s what makes the platform not work. It’s artificially inflated, bloat. I’ve used all the features, and in theory a lot of them are awesome, but they all don’t make you any more successful in finding a date because of those ratios.

Privacy was a huge issue in one of the insistences (Do Not add where you go to school!!!).

Furthermore, my partner and I wanted to find a third consistent partner as that is the lifestyle we wish to live and have the right to do so.

I never once talked in a sexual manner to any male on there, if anything that kind of conversation happend on another social media platform.

2022-06-05 14:44:25,,"I’m not going to list the myriad reasons why tinder is a sub par service, just the app itself.
The app is built to constantly market boost and super like purchases to customers and it’s incredibly annoying. Almost every other time you tap through someones profile you get a large pop up prompt asking you to super like them, which always blocks out location information. Same with liking popular users. In my opinion, a premium paying user shouldn’t be constantly inundated with pop ups trying to siphon more money out of them.
There’s also issues with matching/chat functionality. Likes and messages are regularly dropped, which leads to situations where you think somebody is ignoring you but they just never even got your message. I’ve had a couple chats just get deleted wholesale as well.
For the amount of money this app takes in, it should be much more polished and reliable.

I was, and still am, insanely confused because there’s no way I could’ve violated any terms and conditions or community guidelines since I hadn’t swiped or messaged anyone, I had barely begun to set up my profile. I emailed to see what had happened, but they sent back a generic response saying that they couldn’t give me any more details and there is no appeal process. I followed up and their customer service is unhelpful, slow to respond, and basically at this point I’m just giving up.

2021-07-17 17:43:37,,Overall this app is pretty decent it definitely has more people in match with than others but I was recently banned probably because I had two separate accounts (was unaware this was against TOS) one account was for my business of selling rugs and the other was my personal account. My business account was banned a couple days ago and I was confused as to why until I read the TOS then I made sense and I completely understood why it had happened. But then today I noticed my personal account was banned and it kinda makes sense as well so I tried reaching out to customer service and they stated there is no appeal process for banned accounts which is unfortunate especially as I am a tinder platinum member and paying $30. There should be some sort of appeal process for stuff like this because I never said anything offensive or hurtful to anyone on tinder I just had two accounts which again I was unaware of as most people do not read the TOS or community guidelines.

2022-06-24 06:01:34,,"Tinder is in an odd position as a business: it’s only profitable when it’s not achieving what it claims to achieve. People in happy relationships do not spend $60 a month on “tinder platinum.” The developers have to have just enough features to give you hope,  while trying to keep you single long enough to milk you for all they can. Keep this in mind while using tinder: you are actively fighting against the app itself. 

When tinder first came out, most of its features were free. Unlimited likes, a free super like a day. Now it seems that every time I redownload it, they’re stripped more free features in order to resell them to you at exorbitant prices. Now you get absolutely nothing for free except a handful of regular likes  
 
All in all, as long as you’re aware of the ways the app is scheming to take your money, you can certainly pick a worse dating app. Tinder boasts a large userbase, sleek display, and some fun ways to customize your profile.

Previously, Tinder Gold allotted 5 Super Likes a day…now it’s just 5 a week. To buy more super likes is now SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive. I might be able to overlook that by citing current economic turmoil…but here’s the reality: Tinder should be paying ME for the amount of work I do reporting fake and scammer profiles. I’d say a good 85% of all female profiles are fake or scam. They use the same tricks every time and it wouldn’t be hard for Tinder to police this. I have an MBA in Data Analytics and I know the capabilities exist to identify and delete fake/scam profiles…however the platform wants it to seem like they have more users, so they do nothing. Drop the prices, control who uses your platform, and give back the benefits you took away. If you don’t do this, the app will die. There are 100 other dating apps ready to take your market share and you’ve just handed it over on a silver platter. You will never see another dollar from me.

Tinder is not in the business of match making, in fact quite the opposite, it’s in the business of making you feel desperate enough to spend money on the app. It is designed with planned obsolescence.  

Statistically, men out number women 10 to 1 on tinder. Men average a 0.7% match rate - meaning for every 1000 right swipes, you’ll get 7 matches. That’s a horrendous rate, especially when you consider half of those matches won’t respond, and the other half will be weird/mean/hurt people. You might get 1 good conversation every thousand women you look at. I can easily do better than that going into literally any social environment, this app is terrible.

I also think there’s an issue with banning. The lacking of an appeals process and relying on user complaints or the algorithm to ban people is pure laziness on the tinder team. People get wrongfully banned or banned without knowing why and it’s ridiculous. There’s a lacking of customer service and usually when you want to complain or contact the company you are just redirected over and over again to already posted information On the site.

When I tried reaching out to support they refused to even offer a reason for the ban, wouldn’t help with a refund, and stopped talking to me.

All of a sudden I was matching with girls that are 5k-8k miles away and it’s my understanding that I need to get on a boat just to reach them.

2023-04-13 17:28:11,,I’ve had tinder since 2018 off and on and never had a problem with it until recently. I opened the app one day to see I had been permanently banned. Days after redownloading the app. I had verified my account multiple times and even paid for tinder premium because I thought it would make for a better experience using the app and boy was I wrong. If you don’t answer a man within their set amount of time or do whatever they ask of you they will take it upon themselves to report your account and of course tinder gives you no way to dispute the claims or defend yourself. I emailed their customer service back and forth for a week for them to say that my account was fine on their end and whatever problem I was having unbanning my account was in fact just my problem. Of course tinder would make an option that lets men punish women for not being interested in them.

I tried the subscription service for tinder gold. To be able to see who swiped on me, and to get an occasional boost. However, the Tinder AI is designed to make sure that you pay more money. By lowering the amount of matches you get, then you are forced to upgrade to a better and more expensive subscription. This is the definition of a scam tinder just wants your money, and does not truly want to see people happy and together.

The main issue with the app is that there are too many annoying and repetitive bugs that completely destroy the user experience. 

First off, why even have an option to “only show people in this range” if every other profile you show is 2000+ miles away from the range I set? I mean, I get it. The app runs out of users to show you after a while and is forced to recommend profiles outside the range. But then why not just say that the app has run out of profiles and leave it at that? My guess is that the devs are trying way too hard to waste people’s time and keep them on the app as long as possible.

Second, literally every other swipe I get a notification that says “Super like to increase your odds by 5x.” Now, I personally wouldn’t care about the constant notification. But it’s literally right above the profiles distance for you. Which is the number. one. consideration. when deciding on whether to swipe right or not. Again, this goes back to my initial theory that the devs are looking for ways to keep users on the app.

   I am all in support for pay for convenience apps or just purchasing the membership when they are straight forward to you about it, but when they advertise the app as free and try and use these methods to manipulate you into a subscription is cringe.

It’s unfortunate that so many use this app and not others, so the dating pool on other apps is just smaller. Hopefully people will stray away from tinder and start using others.

Apart from their ridiculous banning system, they keep dropping features from their subscriptions, and raising the prices. They clearly only care about money.

Then they reduced our ""5 superlikes per day"" entitlement to ""5 superlikes per week"". (Men who don't look like Brad Pitt need to send out a lot more likes/superlikes than the best looking guys and most girls, so this affects us the most.)

Next, they use false advertizing to fool you into thinking you actually get 1 boost per month and 5 superlikes per week when you actually get much less than that.

This ""person"" then texts you at fairly regular intervals, particularly first thing in the morning and to say good night in the evening. They each have a story but they stories are dry and generic. If you ask this ""person"" anything specific about where you both live, you basically get answers that you could find from a simple Google search. They put off meeting even though they supposedly live near you. Eventually that becomes pointless interaction and you end up just blocking them.

It’s said because I tried to write to Tinder about my experience of being banned and because I wanted an explanation but they gave me a bogus response. I think it’s crazy that so many good people just get randomly banned. Tinder seriously and immediately needs to rethink this process because they’re banning a lot of genuine people who are serious about dating.

My time, money, and effort has been wasted and I am not too mad about it but it’s just the principle that this can happen is bothersome because I know I did nothing wrong.

2021-02-25 17:01:34,,Tinder is filled with fake profiles that will match with you and then unmatch you. It’s tinders way of stringing you along to make money off of you. Tinder & These dating apps are playing on people’s emotions for profit. Read through the reviews of all the disappointed users there’s a significant pattern of the same reviews consistently which raises a red flag. To the developers you’d actually make more money by providing an honest service. I would spend more money knowing that I could match with real people but since I have studied the patterns of your system I know exactly what your doing and it’s highly dishonest. Tinder has fake profiles that will match with you and converse with you then they will randomly unmatch with you leaving you wondering what did I say or do wrong. It’s tinder’s strategy to keep you on the app. It’s like a video game you can’t beat you will keep playing until you beat it but if you beat the game you won’t play anymore.

Instagram pictures don't display properly, app freezing after I send a message, and not to mention seemingly fake profiles and scammers frequently showing up on my feed. 

I upgraded to tinder platinum because regular tinder is a joke but here, it’s still bad. It claims to give 5 new super likes a week and one boost a month BUT they don’t compound (use em or lose em). This is a scam considering super likes don’t really add up to anything. Many times, you get shown a profile that has been inactive for months and Tinder goes on to prompt you to use your super likes (mind game manipulation) because the person’s profile is “popular” and you’ll get a better chance to match (matching is meaningless) I doubt the legitimacy of what Tinder is proposing and think they just want you to burn your super likes so you buy more. Also, many use the app to re direct you to other apps (snap/instagram thirst traps/scams) or onlyfans 🙄

Improvements: increase standards for entry. Only verified accounts. Make reporting scammers/fakes/bait easier. Fix bugs. Stop with the manipulative prompts. Transparency. Compound superlikes and boosts. Allow to delete old matches we didn’t message. Be honest

I contacted support in hope that it was a simple fix but as I write a long drawn out message to support I am emailed back almost immediately being told that there is nothing I can do and so once again I asked why I had been banned and that if I need to provide some sort of information to fix my account I would do so but the reply I received basically was a tinder representative telling me that there was nothing they can do for they do not offer an appeal service and with this being said I wish to have the money I spent on the app back since they do not want to help a loyal customer such as myself.

1. While I was messaging someone, they disappeared. Two days later they reappeared with one message then eventually all messages. They were wondering if we were still on for our first date since I had stopped responding.  Clearly a bug but tinder customer service just sends standard message of oh they probably unmatched you. :/

3. When I receive notifications that someone likes me about 50% of the time that’s accurate and 50% of the time there’s nothing new to see. :/

4. Based on advice from customer service I reinstalled the app. Then there was a section for messages and a feed for match updates. When I would click on some of the profiles in the feed, it would return a null result. Then I force quit the app and the feed disappeared. When I asked customer service they did not respond. :/

However. The app is so terribly optimized that I MUST close and reopen the app several times during every session. Every aspect of the interface lags on my 256gb iPhone 12 Max: opening or closing a chat window, opening or closing a profile inspection, swiping on people will eventually lag and fail to recognize the full extent of the swipe gesture and cancel the action midway through. Sometimes swiping to close a chat window will render a black screen that requires the whole app to be closed because no touch action will be recognized except iOS gestures like swiping home. 

Additionally, there’s annoying functionality and messaging that pushes purchases in your face. The app can be used without upgrading for satisfactory functionality, but “pay to win” marketing impedes that standard functionality to a ridiculous degree.

2) there are people that ether blatantly or covertly advertise there onlyfans, blatantly prostituting themselves out or scamming people out of money. And the creators don’t seem to be interested in fixing problems 1 or 2. And there are ways for them to fix problems 1 and 2.

3) they come out with some new feature but puts it behind yet another pay wall. The app now has 5 things to pay for 3 of are Subscriptions.

2022-12-28 14:40:57,,"I went from 6 likes a year to a superuser so i think i can fairly review Tinder. 
Tinder has had a cultural impact that is unignorable. 
We use it for friends, hookups, and looking for long term dating partners. 
But it has gamified conversations and dating to a level never before seen. Those who can manipulate and adapt to the visual storytelling of the profile get hundreds if not thousands of matches, and those who can also put cute and cheeky energy into the first message and throughout the conversation can have as many partners as they want.
And therein lies the problem.
You can always have more. There is no limit to the number of men or women you can have if you know how to attract them. So when a relationship has a problem, you can just end it and move onto the next one.
This is very damaging for those who are looking to settle down, because they struggle keeping a partner who has multiple other girls/guys lined up.
Or they have to settle for someone who seems unattractive compared to all the other guys/girls theyve matched with before.
We get our ego stroked here. Even if the other person just wants us for a hookup, or imagines us as a good rebound from their last relationship, we feel a validation on the match that is a reward in itself. 

Some of my best memories were from tinder. But theyre all exes because they are all replaceable.

That’s why when you first open the app they take you straight to the swiping page. They get us addicted to the process of swiping and so when get on for a couple mins we subconsciously rather swipe than talk to the ppl We’ve already matched, because it gives us more of a dopamine boost.

Sometimes they just never come back at all, and not from being unmatched.  Tinder just erases matches on a whim.

Brace yourself. It’s a cold hard world and ghosting doesn’t only happen on Halloween. 

If you love apps that glitch out and only work 43% of the time then tinder is the place for you. Prepare yourself for the blood, sweat and tears that comes with online dating. 

Guys - Are you looking to talk to bots or subscribe to women’s onlyfans and premium snapchats? Do you love being manipulated and used for your money? If you’ve answered yes, then you’ve come to the right place. 

Women - Are you tired of paying for groceries? Swipe right on a solid 4 and never pay for your own dinner for the rest of your life. 

Looking for actual love? Thinking you swiped right on your soulmate? Think again - enjoy the side effects of tinder: crying alone at night in your bedroom while questioning your self worth, excessive drinking, checking snap scores like a paranoid psycho, staring at your phone all day praying for a text that never comes, over thinking every little thing and driving yourself insane.

It can’t be because I’m unattractive because I’m a lady’s man in real life and most women I meet in the real world are all over me and gush about how handsome I am.

For me, this app made it difficult to have and to keep a relationship as I would think of the girls that I could be with via Tinder. Psychologically speaking, there are three things that make you stay in a relationship:
1. Investment into that relationship
2. *Availability of other people*
3. Time in that relationship
Availability is, typically, the most difficult. However, dating apps (and hookup apps, like Tinder) make you feel as though there is a million different people out there, all at your fingertips. They might be, or they might not. It can mess with your head though.

There is nothing more annoying than being woken up in the middle of the night just to see ""you have more swipes come use our subpar app."" Stop being money hungry and give an option to turn off your terrible notifications trying to get me to use your app. If it's not a pretty girl talking to me, then I don't want tinder notifying me.

Edit: this has literally became one of the buggiest, worst apps I have ever seen. Continuously adding useless content, constantly logs you out and ask you to reconnect with Facebook then just says ""account already given permission"" doesn't load things, filled with insane amounts of spam accounts, and ask you leave a review literally every time you use it even if you already have. Don't download this, and definitely do not support the developers.

Edit 2: got banned for telling a girl ""you are not in my dating bracket."" I've had this for 5 years.

2023-10-12 01:44:28,,"So, why is Tinder not working for me?
I am not sure.
I am a reasonably good looking guy and yet I have not had one date since joining a couple months ago.
I used to think tinder was a place you go just a hook up. That’s not necessarily what I want out of this experience with Tangier but it’s been nothing but tumbleweed blowing by. 
The first thing I’m not satisfied with is that I am a 59-year-old man and most of my respondents have been, frankly, overweight, late 60s, geriatrics.
I am a very active human and that’s just not the way I roll.
I joined Tinder to meet people. Maybe, for a date that turns into a friendship – or maybe a hook up that ends with nothing, or even further still a pleasant day that turns into a lifelong relationship. I am just simply trying to put myself out there.
Instead, I get a constant asking for more money to boost my profile with the same results once I gave into the pressure to do so.
I am still hopeful to make a connection with someone, but if the history of the last several weeks, being on the app is any indication, that’s slight at best, and I can be optimistic at a fault.

Yea, refund, as I had just renewed my subscription for a month less than 24 hours from when this happened.

Also, I think the distance filter is glitchy, because even when it says there are no more within my set radius and it’s expanding my search criteria, there are still girls showing up as within my search radius. Also, there is no way there are that many people within a certain area on a dating app. I probably swiped a few hundred times finding girls within 30 miles of me.",3,False,"Fine, but no one’s there.",legendahunter079

2021-03-21 20:17:34,,"Firstly, the ways in which the app attempts to push you to buy premium are incredibly irritating. From regularly reminding you to use your super likes (free users only get one per day) to withholding matches (they will tell you “match with ____ when you buy tinder gold” but will not display that profile in the stack) it creates a poor user experience. 

I could complain about bots, prostitutes, ads, or scams but that’s all common knowledge with this app. 

They will regularly insert advertisements into you matches without prior warning. I have even gotten “new match” notifications only to find that my “new match” is an ad for something I do not care about in the slightest. I have no issue with ads being placed in the stack but I do not want to be told I have a match and get all excited only to find “smile direct club”.

The final issue with this app isn’t even with the app itself. The culture it has allowed to exist in the app is one of “gaining a small ego boost” from a match rather than actually meeting up. I have met up with people from bumble and other apps before but it seems like most people on tinder have little interest in using this dating app for dating.

Not only did Tinder fail to offer any explanation for the ban, but their customer support was unresponsive and unhelpful. It's truly disheartening to see a platform that claims to promote connections and relationships treat their users with such disregard.

Furthermore, the lack of transparency regarding their policies and account suspension procedures is deeply concerning. As a user, I expected a fair and accountable approach from Tinder, but unfortunately, that was not the case.

This incident has made me question the integrity of Tinder as a dating platform. It is essential for users to feel secure and supported, and Tinder's actions have eroded that trust. I would caution anyone considering using this app to be aware of the potential for arbitrary account bans without any explanation.

Swipe limit:
The daily swipe limit was recently massively reduced, making the app borderline unusable without paying for a subscription.

You missed a match:
If I didn’t swipe right on a user, it obviously wasn’t a match. This is a stupid and irritating notification.

Popular user:
This notification pops up on half of the profiles you swipe, prompting you to use a super like to get noticed by someone tinder deems out of your league. It is annoying, and feels like a slap in the face every time it pops up.

Distance feature doesn’t work:
There is a distance slider to supposedly adjust the geographical zone of profiles you are shown. In addition, there is a switch marked “show only people in this range.” With this switch turned on and my range set to 25 miles, more than half of the profiles I see are still thousands of miles away.

After you buy a boost, the app will not show your profile to people unless you boost again. Before boosting I was getting matched regularly, now if I do not boost I never get a match or a like. It’s great marketing for scraping every last penny out of their consumer before they delete the app. My best advice is do not buy anything on this app because until you spend money they will have to show your profile to people in order to try to get you to spend money.

Just don’t ask people if they want a relationship or what they’re “looking for” if you literally don’t seem to support anything other than hookups.

I think it’s partially the people using the app. No one wants (or at least the men who have matched with me,  which since I started using it in 2018) anything more than a casual hookup. You are lucky to go on a “date”. It’s pretty much standard across the board on any “dating app”. 

I got sexually assaulted by a guy off this app and literally tinder couldn’t do anything about it. Men put their penis as their profile pic. There’s screenshots of sexual acts people want to have happen like pegging. Men will even blur out their faces and not post what they look like.

Tinder used to be better a few years ago tbh and I wasnt that much younger… the worse the app is, the more they can profit off the frustrated people who feel they need to pay for it in order to get matches.

Then they tell you the email has to match the account and I had to prove, with a screenshot, that the email matched the account. To make matters worse, asked to verify several times (did not change my pictures) and then all of a sudden I was banned and deleted.

You can’t necessarily reap all benefits as a premium member as you become overwhelmed by people who aren’t even real.

Plain and simple. They removed the ability to look at a persons profile. The entirety of filling out your bio in profile is now no longer available to be seen by other people. I’m sure they have put it behind the pay wall, as usual for this terrible company. 

The fact that you have to pay for literally everything on this app that many others do for free is not only the worst customer practice ever, but now you can’t even look at an actual profile to see either what a person is looking for, information about them to see if he will actually connect or match with them, or if they are actually looking for anything or just friends, or even if they are a man or a woman.

I can understand hiding some of the other features like increased matching or search boosting, or even the ability to have additional swipes or likes behind a pay wall, but hiding the bio and information from people is the scariest thing possible.

Supposedly it was revenge because I dated a guy that they wanted to be with (which I actually never did they had me confused with my ex best friend).

Not to mention the problem with likes which is shown but for some reason u never run into those people that liked u. Right now I have 20 something likes and haven’t matched in days.

First, it is incredibly hard to match with people without paying. I don’t know if it was just me or my profile, but I rarely matched with anyone.

Second, I was randomly banned from the service after not using it for a few days. The worst part? I didn’t even get a reason. My best guess is that I shared my Snapchat with somebody in a DM and Tinder didn’t like that. I could reach out to support and appeal, but maybe it’s for the better.

I signed up for a Platinum subscription to make sure I didn’t miss a conversation or message and it was all for nothing. I have definitely received way more “likes” here (over 500 so far and counting) but just not from many men that I have anything in common with.

Shadowbanning is when they don’t tell you they banned you but your app doesn’t work properly and you can still see people but you can’t swipe on them because it resets everytime you reopen the app, so you see the same people you swiped on.

They do this so they can still take money from you, secretly not telling you you’re shadowbanned and banking on you continuing to pool money into the app. I had to squeeze information out of their support, in which they eventually told me I was banned and this was after I did research on reddit for this ""bug"".

Summary:
There are a lot of flaws with this app that make it so clearly geared toward keeping you on the app as long as possible and encouraging you to upgrade your plan (I.e. Likes expire after 24 hours!)

I did the research as well. Studies (not articles but actual studies) prove that the people succeeding on dating apps are the ones succeeding with irl pursuing dating as well (yes there are exceptions but I’m talking majority). If you are not in that crowd- you better start practicing meeting girls irl. 

If you want to use a dating app use Hinge. It’s designed for relationships not hookups but it is way better in design and functionality.

Tl;dr:
Either use Hinge or just save yourself time and money: Go find a pretty girl in a public setting, smile and make eye contact in a not creepy way, if she smiles back approach her.

Most profiles on this app are just people wanting them to go follow their Instagram, and yet the people who are banned are those who are genuine people just looking to see what this app has to offer.

I am disappointed in the care that you have for your customers. The company advertises that they care about their own customers. I would say that this is borderline to deceptive and misleading advertising. I keep seeing the same thing happen to people which is that they get banned and customer support tells them to pound sand. You can’t rely 100% on technology it sometimes makes mistakes too. 

I wish this company would do better. If you care about the customers, make sure that you fully commit to it. Listen to what they have to say. Many people are getting swept under the rug and this is unacceptable.

1. Fake users and spams account will
Clog your account, and I think once you pay for it the re is about giving you matches in order to make you believe your money is worth it. 

2. App will start getting glitch once you get some matches. You could try refreshing it but it will not help. 

3. Costumer support for this app is the worst. You will try to contact them but all they provided is scripted messages. While trying to appeal they obviously don’t know what’s going on and won’t provide you any explanation of what’s going on. 

4. The community guidelines are not watched properly. Your account will get banned out of nowhere for any reason other than those in the community guidelines. IE. using a VPN. Also. 

5. Sassy broads. You will find many here that if you are not to their liking they will simply report your account.",1,False,Frustrating,mithivan

Hi,

Thanks for your reply. After some investigation, it appears that your account has been caught in one of our anti-spam filters.

If you're being asked to verify that you're human, please follow the prompts on the screen and solve the puzzle shown. In some cases, you may be asked to complete multiple puzzles. Once you’ve successfully completed the puzzle(s), you should be able to continue using Tinder normally.

We appreciate your understanding and hope this helps!
