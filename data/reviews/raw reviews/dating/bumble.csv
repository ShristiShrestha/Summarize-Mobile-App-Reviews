Its easy to use and it offers speed dating every Thursday. however, I wish some of the features were more personalized or offered as add-ins. For example I would like the option to pay for bee-line (allows you to see who likes your profile) without having to pay for a full subscription like premium or boost. Other than that, the app itself is fine. The biggest problems you ladies (straight cis-gender) will run into isn’t really the app’s fault. After you match with someone, you’re given 24hrs to message them and they only have 24hrs to respond. A lot of times, guys don’t respond at all. You’ll also run into men who are just looking for hookups, which is typical. The other issue is the never ending one-sided small talk. A lot of these guys can’t hold a conversation or they expect you to do all of the work because bumble requires women to initiate the conversation. If your goal is to land a date in person, it’s going to take some patience, unless of course you’re a super model or something. Overall, its always ideal to meet ppl in person, but I think Bumble is a safe platform to explore your options. Use this as a supplement for your dating routine.

Literally just scrolling very slowly and suddenly it likes a person. Or often the reason I’m scrolling is someone caught my eye and I want a closer look. Swiped no out of nowhere without swiping no! Horrible. When you’re at the end of a instagram feed and you try swiping to the next page it swipes no. They didn’t think that one through. You have to click the last pic then swipe the no aka left to see the next pics. Literally only Bumble has problems with the most basic part of a dating app that they all offer. 

Okay so don’t get me started on the actual purpose of the app; dating. That aspect is imbecilic, girls have to talk and wont. They’ll give out their details and you say so what happened? Oh I don’t check it when I match. Okay but you literally don’t understand the app. Useless app for that. My real complaint is purely as an app. It’s really bad. Name one other app where simply scrolling randomly changes to the next or previous page out of nowhere. It’s frustratingly broken. Even being super cautious. And for years now. If y’all can’t make the app work rewinding swipes should just be available for like/dislike. Like hey somehow we’re the only app that can’t get the basic function of scrolling to work literally the most important part.

If I am not interested in somebody, I do not change my mind simply on the fact that they’re interested in me. That’s not a healthy way to start a relationship, and it’s an obvious attempt at a cash grab for Bumble. That's not a feature that helps any user, because the info isn’t offered until after you’ve already swiped left, at which point you have to pay if you wanted to take advantage of the feature. Either they believe you should be with somebody just because they like you even if the feeling isn’t mutual, or even more likely, is they don’t really care about being a platform to make positive relationships and they just want your money. Stop insulting our intelligence Bumble

Update: now bumble has a feature where they take your most attractive potential matches (people who already swiped right on you) and show you that they’re your potential matches, but they don’t let you swipe right on them without paying money. Worse than that however, these greedy mfers put those potential matches I’m assuming all the way in the back of the people you’d swipe through normally, so you won’t come across them, and if you want the match you have to pay.

Every day I’m grateful that bumble exists for this reason. I do not have the app anymore for obvious reasons, but I recommend it highly to anyone who is looking to find a real, loving and healthy relationship. Most dating apps are set up for hookups and such. With bumble this is not the case if you don’t want it to be. I love the idea of the girl talking first too. As a girl, this does make things a little awkward, but it helps to be the one making the first move. As in other dating apps, guys typically hit girls with pickup lines or flat out ask if they want to hook up. I felt like I could explain what I was looking for so much easier with bumble. My personal trainer had recommended it to me after he found his now wife on the app. I’m so glad he told me about it.

By not banning outright, this allows them to take your money and not be held accountable.  Tinder has done this for a long time, and I suspect there is not only a back-channel sharing a blacklist amongst all Match-owned sites but also industry-wide.  Reports against your profile (credible or not) are never properly investigated; anything at all will do as long as you are male, especially white, to justify adding you to a list to ensure your profile will never get shown to others.  They track everything... email, phone, billing information, wireless networks, photo hashes.  And now they use AI to retarget in case you use different photos or alter another to change the hash.  The point is, once you are on this list, even if you change phones, emails addresses, short of plastic surgery, you will continue to be shadow banned across all platforms.  Conspiracy?  Yes.  Fraudulent due to them continuing to take money with the customer expectation they will receive the same service ad everyone else?  Absolutely.  One day all of this will be exposed, but it won't happen any time soon.  Save your money and find some other means to make connections.

And I’m not saying this as a bummed out nerd who is taking their lack of female attention out on the app itself; I use just about every other dating platform and get consistent likes/matches.

They could easily offer a lower tier of premium with the use of ad revenue, rather than banking that users will pay the exorbitant amount of money required to get your profile out there - and that goes for all dating apps. 
This no doubt causes users to lose faith in the app, or the process in general, and it’s not a sustainable business model.

A major issue that I have is that men can’t filter by weight. I don’t find myself personally attracted to heavier-set women because it’s often times a visualization of the lower standards they have for themselves. Also, I think the majority of healthy men are unattracted to overweight women just like how the majority of women are unattracted to short men. I seem to live in an area where there is a fairly high proportion of overweight women and I waste so much time having to swipe through large volumes of them.

What is unfair about this is that women have the ability to filter based on height. Now I’ve been blessed with being 6’3 but I understand from friends how difficult it can be to generate interest from women if they’re short. That being said, I totally understand and believe that the women on this app should be able to filter on height.

I don’t think I’m quite what lesbians are looking for bumble? But once I set my gender back to “male” I’m brought back to women who are interested in men. So I have no choice but to just put “male” and then that I’m “trans” in my bio. So maybe something needs to be changed about that? Why should I feel that I’m less of a man on this app? I get that you try and pair “lgbtq+” with others in that same category, but make it make sense. If I say I’m “straight” I should only be seeing what my preference is. If others choose to not like me because I’m trans, let them make that decision.",3,False,Josh_805,"Gender settings are nice, but a bit weird."

Nothing after that first hour (I live in a large metropolitan area so this is unusual). I’m also not an ugly guy by any means.

I noticed that one particular like I had showed up in my stack and I didn’t swipe on it initially. I reopened the app later to see my likes disappear. HOWEVER, these profiles still showed up in the stack and they are unable to unlike your profile once they’ve swiped right. This happened with almost all of the likes I had and they weren’t bot profiles. I received no more likes since that first hour and I kept the app for a week and a half to make sure.

Not me, because it feels like I’m shopping for a person and putting myself on a market (which is really what dating apps are for, obviously). 

However, with the free version, you can send messages to matches (they have 24 hours to respond) and you have unlimited messages once you match. In addition, Bumble adapts. I actually like that they changed it to only allowing you to view/like a few people at a time — it helps keep you logging in, so you maybe won’t miss messages with/from matches. A downside to this change, though, is that I always have, like, 50 likes (most of them I won’t like back because we’re clearly incompatible in some way), and it’s going to take longer to make matches with those likes.

Let’s say I pay for premium (I once considered lifetime which I’m not sure is an option anymore?). Sure, I’d get unlimited swipes, but any women using the free version still get 25/day, so this will make the smaller population pickier which just hurts everyone. 

Idk for sure, but I’m willing to bet the population that pays most are straight men. Maybe consider increasing the free limit for just women to 50+/day?

Except for one thing, the best men left apps a long time ago and are looking for relationships elsewhere. Not because they want to go back to a time when men dominated women, but just because they want to be in equal footing, and feel free to embrace the positive side of their masculinity. Like being bold, decisive, courageous, protective. How can you do this when apps like Bumble force you into a submissive posture and give women too much power to kick men off the platforms for acting “inappropriately” as defined, or not, by women. Are women happier with this new found power? Not in my experience. Statistically, they are opting for other women, or dogs, or seeking out therapists to figure out why they can’t achieve satisfaction in their relationships. And apps like Bumble are part of the problem. But the good news is that this is mostly a US phenomena.

Anyone can literally submit a report accusing someone of bad offline behavior. Bumble makes no effort to verify or follow up, they just ban. It’s a joke.

However, the dual features of matches expiring after 24 hours and only women being able to respond first to curb harassment makes it rather difficult for people like me, the good-intentioned though usually overlooked users, to be easily ignored.

Happened to get off all dating app platforms shortly afterwards until just recently, and trying to get my purchase restored to my new account has been a nightmare.

First off, I’m fairly certain Bumble is the sole app that lacks an in-app purchase restoration option, which feels pretty shady.  As far as I can tell, they also lack a customer service chat AND phone number, leaving e-mail as the only available method.  Initially, I was told they couldn’t find my purchase receipt.  Then, after explaining that I was not the primary account holder in my Family Plan and perhaps it was tied to that email — though it shouldn’t be, as it was made my from previous Bumble account tied to my Apple ID — they stated they had in fact already found it, but they would instead need the payment confirmation from my email.  Ended up providing it in a response, then tried following up and even sent a whole new inquiry, and still have yet to hear anything from them after several hours.

I have to ask, is this an intentional run-around to withhold services despite payment?  Perhaps even aiming at further purchases made out of exasperation?",2,False,ComfyCostes,Pretty Horrendous Customer Service

Once a blue moon you’ll get lucky and they will show the person who liked you in the free version. I’ve even done the paid version multiple times for about six months worth. It’s outrageously priced at $40 a month. They’re insane charging this for multiple reasons. 85% of the likes you’ll receive are fake profiles that say “add my snap” and the 15% that do match you that are real don’t message you since the ladies have to message first. I’ve even utilized their boost multiple times during peak hours and got barely any likes. Which by the way boosts cost money and you only get one free one a week with premium then they’re about $7 each after that. So you end up buying the bundle deals. This app is a cash grab trust me don’t ever pay for it. Honestly don’t even use it. The free version is terrible.

Free members can select only two filters for their search, but since you can see if someone is verified from the blue symbol next to their name, you don’t really need to waste one on that.  I also appreciate that conversations are initiated by the women.  This allows me to reach out to only people I am interested in and decreases the amount of shallow “hi beautiful” opening lines I have to deal with.

I am nonbinary and the BFF section of the app only allows you to view people who share the same gender as you. Being that we are are such a small percentage of the population, this only allows me to see very few people in my area (practically none). I wrote to support explaining the issue and asking if I could have three option of selecting who I want to be friends with since I do not use gender to determine who will be a friend. They refused to accommodate my request and said they only allow you to match with your same gender to discourage misuse of the app. I feel this practice only caters to one demographic and the issue could easily be resolved by them allowing users to select which genders they are open to being friends with, similar to how other apps do it. It’s clear they only care about satisfying one demographic and couldnt care less about anyone else.

They also refused to update my name despite me telling them it’s my deadname. They insisted I show ID when I explained my IDs only have my deadname.

It almost feels like you’re penalized for not paying for the app. What the app offers doesn't warrant the prices for their premium memberships. I’ve also experimented with the options and they sometimes lock potential matches that fit all of your filters behind your beehive and won’t show them to you no matter how many times you swipe.
There’s no real time limit given when you run out of swipes. This could work against them when people have notifications turned off and live busy lives. Out of sight out of mind and they’re are more and better interactive apps.
Overall the UX and UI is good, but as all things, could use some improvement. The time spent on the app is limited due to low swipe limit and 24hour match jail. Also, their prices and mistakes they make with purchases doesn’t help their cause. Also, I didn’t get a vaccination option like other people, which is a bug that I can’t fix without deleting my account.

Hence, you wait 20 hours for their vanity and ego boost then they unmatch. Another problem I encountered was the castle wall of payments to even attempt to change that outcome. 30 likes, literally swipes to say i’m interested in talking, cost $100 freaking dollars. Your premium account price is akin to a Gold’s Gym membership or a nice meal I could’ve spent on a date. 26 dollars a month isn’t breaking banks but it’s stupid considering what you’re giving. All these dating apps must be smoking meth, it is sad to see you set that steep a price and gatekeep what essentially is a gamble on a half built platform.

There needs to be some sort of hard timer that the end user can see that lets you know “Hey, you’ve got this much time before you can swipe right again”. But that would defeat the point of artificially restricting swipes-and it’s not because Bumble encourages “conscious” swiping. A restriction like this and lack of a visible way to tell when you can swipe again encourages engagement with the algorithm and pushes you to pay their insane monthly subscription cost. 

It’s honestly just gonna drive me to engage with Tinder more or just disengage from online dating apps entirely.

So how do I know these profiles are legitimate? Are these people even on this app anymore? Most of the people I really was hoping to interact with don’t interact back - even with a match. Extending the time limit for a match hoping to contact you is pointless - they do not respond 99% of the time.

Relationships aren’t always easy, dating isn’t always easy, and the added quarantine and societal pressures aren’t helping, but it can still happen. We have lots of mutual friends, and even some of the same hang out spots, and had never come across each other!

I don’t have her luck. For me I feel like I always want to start with something casual meanwhile getting to know that person and see where that takes us. And last Saturday someone ghosted me on our first date night, after we’ve been FaceTime each other every day for a week. In real life this would never happen I guess it’s online dating so they feel safe to be a jerk lol.  I am an attractive women I know it’s not me, in real life I’m someone who has beauty privilege(not proud of it it’s a fact tho) I’m looking for someone at my level who’s respectful, so far online dating doesn’t work for me but I’m still trying.
And I know this is not on Bumble, it’s a fact for online dating, we’re putting ourselves out there try to find connections, and feeling so replaceable.
I like the app design but they charge you just to see who likes you which it’s not cool, and that’s why I gave a 3 star.

I have grown up in a extremely misogynistic community where I inherited most of the behaviors, self-concept, and everything about “love” and “partnership.” Unsurprisingly, this was a miserable time of my life, and after I reflected, it was all connected to my lack self awareness, self love, and boundaries. Getting bumble has shown a whole world of opportunities. It taught me the magic of moving on, accepting rejection, setting boundaries and never negotiating with less than I deserve, and most importantly that there’s always someone else, always.

Bumble, like Tinder also doesn’t show your profile barely at all after the first few days. I went from getting 10+ likes every day to barely getting 2 in a week. They just try to encourage you to pay extra for their features that should just be part of the app in general.

I’m sure there must be a way Bumble can address this issue but they have never put any effort into adding prompts or questionnaires or giving women any leg up on the pickup game.

1. Speed dating game.
If you don’t pay and search without spotlight you end up getting around 3-4 chats. If you do it with spotlight you most likely get 4-8. If you don’t pay for spotlight you are wasting your time. I’ve tried the speed dating multiple times without spotlight and checked every single person I’ve talked with and not a single match made. It’s clearly a scam which you’ll only get a match or two if you are paying for spotlight.

2. Matches
As I’ve said I’ve had this app for a month. I’m that month I only had one match. Just one! And pretty sure it was a fake account by bumble for false hopes to keep me using their app. I gave the person additional time but at least I go no answer.

3. Profiles
Unless you pay can you get verified accounts but nothing says they aren’t fake accounts by bumble or other users. So unless you pay do you really have additional chances of meeting someone

Overall:
I’ve used tinder before. Banned on day two like many others for posting memes. I wouldn’t recommend getting this app unless you don’t mind waiting an year of your life to get on here. I’ve got better chances of an real life match just going for it so bye bumble.

However, it seems reasonable to imagine that if a woman is really interested she might ask me a question about myself, or my experience. It’s also not accurate that women will even give out their number after several weeks of chatting and video calls. For many women finding a man that’s actually available it seems is their worst fear. I’m willing to pursue, and express interest, I don’t think it’s absurd to want a partner to also express a desire to be with me. Women on the app will report you for telling them you don’t think you guys are a match, all the while stringing you along with no intention of actually dating you.

The first of them being that the advertised pictures to coax you into downloading the app are nowhere near close to the photos you actually see, in terms of quality. You’ll have very pixelated photos and the accuracy of the size(of the actually photo versus the size you are shown) is misleading. I like to see high quality pictures, but I understand now everyone has a high quality camera. When I see low quality, I think low interest in the actual usage/goal of the app and it’s user.

Secondly, you should not have to pay to have unlimited swipes. The point of a dating app is to see who you like based off their profile, not to ‘save’ your likes for just the ones who really stand out. Same reason for advanced filters. 

The more positive note I have is that I have gotten more replies on here than anywhere else (by just a couple people), and some conversations have moved into different methods like texting or Snapchat. If anyone is downloading this for the first time, it may take a while to find someone you match with. I’d also recommend downloading other apps as well because, of course, Bumble isn’t the only dating app out there.

I have found a lot of men who date on bumble a little entitled passive lazy mamas boys and are used to dating women who do all the work. They typically enjoy the female attention.  (The dating mode puts women in the driving seat where they have to be the one to pursue and initiate conversation with men). I am old fashioned and have feminine energy rather than masculine so I don’t feel comfortable approaching men I might like and am used to being pursued, and the man doing all the work. So if you are that type of woman, bumble date may not be for you. If you’re a feminine type woman, you may prefer an app like hinge, where men pursue you and you have the option to decline any advances if you do wish. You also have the option on hinge to pursue men if you wish but there is more mutuality there than Bumble date.",4,False,feminine ofg,Interesting Dynamic

Thus, I feel it is UNJUST that Bumble forces me to waste swipes on girls who are taller than me whereas this would not be an issue for tall guys. This action to remove the advanced filters as a free option (at least the one for height) is borderline discrimination and is something that Bumble devs will not understand unless they talk to other short guys.

-Easy to use

-I like the layout of the profiles, the ability to add 3 answered questions (profile prompts), COVID preferences are easy to see

-One customer service inquiry was answered in a timely fashion (direct via FB messenger)

-Weekly subscription option that not all services offer 

-Several other nice little options, like the ability to expand your search by 2 miles (should be able to choose 5mi IMO)

Cons: 

-There’s an apparent issue that happens when you’re viewing/reading a profile, it randomly and inexplicably changes to a different profile without warning. Sometimes you don’t see that other profile again. Happens with potential matches also, and the like can disappear as if you swiped left (happened to me, missed that match). This means the app is pretty much making it so you can’t potentially match with people, which is rather counterproductive. 

-Can’t reset & view profiles that were already seen, only the last 3 viewed and only if you have the right sub; much like Tinder

-Can’t delete profile prompts (questions) once one is used

-Premium is pricy for the current state of the app but to be fair I think they’re all a bit overpriced

-No adding custom interests, prompts etc

Biggest complaint is the swipe reset timer. Rather than resetting at a set time (i.e. midnight), you have to wait a full 24 hours from the time you ran out of swipes until you can resume. The fact that this hasn’t been addressed tells me it’s deliberate so that users are inconvenienced into paying for an upgrade.

The women choose format is kind of refreshing but it seems like a lot of women either don’t know how the app works, are too timid to actually “make the first move” (a.k.a. literally type/send one letter or more to enable a conversation) or just swiped for kicks thinking it wouldn’t actually match. So, as refreshing as the different approach may be, it leaves a bit to be desired in practice.

There a decent amount of active users in most areas, which is essential. Unfortunately, you have to pay to see if anyone is interested. That might not be so bad if it was a reasonable price but $30/mo  to find out a bunch of people you weren’t interested in liked you is a total ripoff.

Overall, I’d recommend Hinge over Bumble or Tinder. Other services claim to care about your experience but monetize the crap out of critical features. Hinge, on the other hand, gives you all of that stuff for free. Yes, you read that correctly; they don’t make you pay to see who “likes you”.

A little over one year later my green-eyed guy and I went to Italy together and he proposed to me in front of the Trevi Fountain. I’m not the kind of girl that cheesy rom-com things happen to except for this one instance. Thank God for Bumble.

Most of the people on this app are very superficial, insecure, immature, argumentative, flakey and difficult to get along with. For Bumble BFF, I’ve come across women who only want to grow their Instagram followers. Also met some friends who ended up being very flakey, unreliable, which led to very one sided friendships. Also emphasizing immature as these women are in their 30s and taking many pics “for the gram” as if they’re teenagers. Most of the girls I met had trouble making friends, and I now understand why: People are also very behind in their careers, so don’t expect to feel like your interacting with an adult. As for the dating, men are extremely picky. They want a supermodel, but don’t have good qualities themselves. If you don’t want to chat or date me, don’t then don’t right swipe on me.

Matches expire in 24 hours if you don’t message. I doubt this will ever change since it makes you open the app more often so that’s obviously beneficial to the company. It’s very annoying though.

That has more to do with the users and not the app itself but there are issues with the app too. The filter only lets you add what you are interested in rather than exclude something you don’t want.

I’ve been thinking a lot about gender stuff recently (changed my pronouns to she/they on the app) and the new gender thing was a bit startling when it was clear it wasn’t optional to fill it out. So I had a mini existential crisis and tentatively selected non-binary and then gender questioning since that wasn’t an option under woman. Now I’ve matched with someone who selected “woman” and I can’t message her first because I’m questioning my gender and identifying as non-binary? This doesn’t make any sense. The idea is supposed to be that the less privileged gender can message first, yeah? So why can’t I, identifying as non-binary, message a woman first? Did you rank it? Highly recommend y’all reconsider this format. This is catering to cis straight women.

1. Please remove the feature of swiping left to right for replying to a message.

UI: 
awful. it’s been clunky for years and nothing has changed. you’re required to scroll down to view profiles but the app sometimes reads a down scroll (no matter how careful you are) as a left or right swipe. and now all the sudden you’ve matched without someone you didn’t want to and they’re messaging you and you feel bad. this isn’t even a once in a while thing, this happens all the time. 

time limits: i like the idea of having women make the first move. makes the app feel more safe i guess. less chance of weirdos and unwanted dms. however the limit is 24 hours and then if you haven’t reached out or vice versa (depending on who’s turn it is) then you loose the match unless you pay money to get it back. I just wish that it was like 48 hours at least or even 36. it’s definitely not uncommon for me to forget to check the app for a day. and then anything that may have happened during that time is gone. i think alternatively having the timer start once the other person opens the app would be fine. because if i match and they don’t open the app for 24hrs then it’s gone.

And to be able to connect with more people.

They advertise and suggest these features are truly unlimited when it’s not.

If you are on the free version they cap you on daily activity.

If you use the premium they see doing too much activity as spam. And can block you from the app  at any time without warning.

Due to all the technical issues I was having and people not getting my messages on the app.
I suggested people could reach out to me on Instagram or continue to speak here within the app.
(You can have your Instagram attached to your profile. Which would mean anyone could see your Instagram if they desired to.)
Which is why I ONLY shared a partnered app as an additional means of communication due to Bumbles technical issues.
I would of been more patient, however connections do expire if you do not message them promptly.

Make BumbleBFF GSRM friendly. 

I’m tired of one gender and lack of diversity. You allow more genders but put those genders into two boxes, creating a genuinely undesired atmosphere. I deleted this app and will not redownload it until I see some significant steps towards inclusivity on BumbleBFF. 

And, the subscription is insane. I hear Apple is hammering down on scams based on the criteria of being ridiculously expensive for what an app offers. This lowkey sounds just like Bumble. 

I did a survey this year and was asked to participate in a research/informational study. I specifically stated that I only used BumbleBFF in the survey and in the emails going back and forth inquiring about the study I was asked to participate in by Bumble based on my survey. Yet, once the pre-interview occurred, all the questions were for BumbleDating. Not cool. So much of my time and energy was wasted because no one paid attention to my survey details. Isn't the whole point of doing surveys is to look at the details???? - coming for a survey analyst. 

Many massive changes need to be made on BumbleBFF before I consider using it and re-downloading it.

1) PLEASE add options for ethical non-monogamy. OkCupid has this in spades and I see where some people have wasted their time on a match that doesn’t actually match with them. It’s simply because the question was never asked and it takes up real estate in the limited profile space.

2) The profile is very limiting. There’s something to be said for “less is more”, but when all you get is three pictures and two sentences, it’s just not much to go off of. We only get to list five interests? I have DOZENS. I understand not wanting things to get too cluttered, but please give me more room to work with.

3) I would love an option to rate profiles, especially when I’m swiping left. I don’t need to be able to send more than one message.

Since I am using it as a free service I don’t go swipe crazy because I know that the females have to message first and I can’t keep 20 conversations going so it’s actually kind of nice to only scroll on it for a few people a day to see if there is mutual connection.

1) the use of meaningless hieroglyphic icons that seem to randomly switch around on every page makes navigation very tedious and difficult; WHEN will developers learn to use text menus that we can just look at to see what they’re for, instead of having to experiment by clicking on every one to see if they do something useful or are what we’re looking for?  A single drop down text menu in the upper left corner where menus belong would be a massive improvement in usability, instead of scattering meaningless hieroglyphs randomly around the screen. 

2) poor contrast of light yellow-orangey text on white backgrounds in Setup areas makes certain operations slow and difficult. Not as bad as the use of meaningless icons, but still unnecessary. Suspect the developer isn’t using naive testers on a variety of devices like he should, but instead is probably developing on a Mac with a high contrast screen where his light-on-light text is discernible and where the use of meaningless hieroglyphics for navigation has long been standard practice—and the reason that I and many others loathe Apple products.",1,False,Simanonok,Improved from before

They just send you a generic message say “we are sorry” and “unfortunately it’s not our fault” and “there’s nothing we can do”. Bumble is a nice thought for a dating app but they should make changes.

A $30 monthly subscription obtains only the most basic features like unlimited swipes, 5 superswipes (which supposedly gain a greater level of attention from potential matches) and 1 spotlight per week. If you want any greater visibility it’s $60 or more per month which is absurd for a mobile dating app. 

Speed dating almost never works, and after “searching for matches” and “expanding search distance” comes back with a prompt to buy spotlights at $2 a pop, which actually bare zero relevance on the speed dating function - yet another sign of a money grab scheme preying on a man’s loneliness.

* I would say if the remaining 15% of profiles, the person checks it maybe once a month or so, which means that whomever has swiped on them has also gone missing.

* Since women make the first move (I wonder how that works in people seeking same-sex relationships), even after “matching,” the match “expires” about 90% of the time. The remaining 10% will carry on a few single word answers (“Hi!”) and then disappear.

The problem with Bumble, like all the other dating apps, is there there is no transparency or accountability. There is no way of knowing whether a profile is “active,” if the person logs in regularly, or whether they are interested in anything more than “looking to see who’s out there.”

Standard tinder ripoff, but the swipe function is so ludicrously sensitive that I often accidentally swipe just because of the way I’m holding the phone.

I get daily notifications from Bumble, usually multiple a day, and it gets very annoying. I like that prompts are an option but a significant number of profiles don’t answer any of them and are usually only a couple words.

One, after we are out of swipes for the day, please provide a count down clock for when it will open back up ( just like Tinder).
Also, after time ran out and the people we matched with in our inbox turns grave, can they automatically get moved to a “missed out” folder? You could even play it as “… if you pay you can activate all of this guys and talk to them…”. 
Also, can you tell us how many swipes-right we get for free each day? Or is it a certain about if guys and if we swipe left or right it doesn’t matter?

- only received 10 compliments
- few matches

- 4 likes a day on average (you won’t know who they are until you swipe left to miss a potential match)

I emailed bumble and they ignored me. I googled my issue and found that I wasn't the only one. In fact, I found that they changed it so that now, you have to PAY for compliments, but bumble just never said anything about it and thought no one would notice. Greedy pricks.

For starters, give people more than 24 hours. People work, and don’t get on the app every day or multiple times a day. This is a missed opportunity for meeting someone.
Also, here I read a profile and think I’d be interested in someone, get down to their location, and they’re at an airport within my mile range, but live on the other end of the country. There’s a reason I put a mileage limit on it, I don’t want a long distance relationship.
Also, if you travel, (because the app tracks your location), you’ll get people within that mile range no matter where you go, instead of keeping it around where you actually live/will want to have a relationship.
Because of these reasons, this app isn’t worth using, in my opinion. It’s a good initial idea, but the people I matched with, I may have missed an opportunity because they weren’t on every day. Again, people work, have kids to take care of, etc.

I read through them and took special notice of their policy against identity-based hate. 

Their policy is specifically for “marginalized” or “minoritized” communities which is liberal PC speech for people who aren’t straight white males. 

If ALL people are protected, the language wouldn’t specify marginalized/minoritized people, but instead say they don’t tolerate hate based attacks on race, sex, gender, religion, etc.

Bumble pride themselves on being “inclusive” and “welcoming” yet the language used in their guidelines give certain groups of people more privilege over others as akin to what you see in the media today regarding racial politics and there being different standards based on race, sex, and religion. 

It’s common for liberal/leftwing media companies to allow discriminatory attacks against straight white males. Their personal biases affect how they enforce their rules and some of you may have experienced this with other social media/dating apps where the majority of their workforce are liberals with these same prejudices. 

Read the guidelines yourself as I have. See that they’re meant for “protected classes” of people and not for everybody.",1,False,DayumQuitPlayin,Updated Guidelines Aren’t Inclusive

The very first day there was an influx of likes, and in the weeks since I've received around 5 total. Compare this with Hinge, where likes are more direct than a simple right swipe, yet I receive them on a daily basis. I use the same photos on both apps; the only difference is the apps themselves.

That influx of likes you get your first day on Bumble seems very manipulative considering your profile will likely not receive that kind of attention ever again. They try to get you hooked with an initial burst of likes, and then they start pushing their absurdly priced premium features. It's embarrassingly transparent.

If you're serious about making quality connections, Bumble is unfortunately no longer the place to do it. Your time and energy are better spent elsewhere.",1,False,HamsterJuice,"Arbitrary algorithm with overpriced premium ""features"""

Why you ask? Well, I have tried previously several others they are all meat market hook ups. Not what I am interested in. I believe that it’s sad that people don’t want to actually get to know a person anymore .
I am a professional (Female Law Enforcement) and I see too many bad things happen to women and men from others they meet on these sites. 
Bumble this far seems to be the only site where I am comfortable being myself .
There have been some that have  ghosted  me once they find out what I do for a living and that tells me a lot about someone. 
I have come to the conclusion that If I’m not in a position to pay for a dating app or service then whomever I swipe on if they match with me then that’s great! If not oh well, it’s not meant to be!
The key is don’t chase and don’t be so desperate to give up yourself just to have someone - be GENUINE BECAUSE eventually it catches up and relationships fail. Bumble allows for that regardless … I no longer use and haven’t any other sites  for a couple yrs now.

If you do not have premium, you can not see guys who liked you. Instead, you get a line up of a random pick of guys to swipe through.

So I decided to get premium, and I’m not trying to sound funny or arrogant in any way AT ALL, but I’m a pretty good looking woman...
 Tinders premium gave me 100’s of likes a day, yet I was only receiving 3 guys who ‘liked’ my profile in a day on bumble. 
I’m sorry, but that doesn’t make sense. 

Even on premium, the algorithm doesn’t work in your favor.
 
Good thing I had put my snap hashtag in my bio when I made the profile. I kinda figured that if a guy REALLY wanted to talk to me, he would contact me in any way he could. 

Honestly, Ladies, you can really benefit from just throwing your snap/insta out there, it could save you money. I paid for the premium, and still didn’t meet anyone that way.

The average attractiveness level of people Bumble is below 5, while 7 on Hinge, in my opinion.

all seriousness it seems as if there is something poor in its design at showing profiles to other people and i can only base that on 11 likes on tinder 0 on bumble. though on tinder i never specified i was looking for a relationship and the few i matched with seemed to be wanting a hookup so i really dont know.

0/10 like most apps if you just struggle at looking average.",4,False,"""Help me"" - Baby Yoda",Uhhhhh
