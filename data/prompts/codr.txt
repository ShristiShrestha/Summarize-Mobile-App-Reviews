Instructions:
You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the reviews of the {{app}} app.
Repeat the following 2 steps {{iterations}} times.
Step 1:	Identify {{num_missing_entities}} informative entities from the reviews which are missing from the previously generated summary.
Step 2:	Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities.
Note: An entity is a user-defined issue in the reviews that is perceived to harm or support their goals. This includes the functional or non-functional features of the app.

A missing entity is:
- relevant to the app's operation,
- specific yet concise (5 words or fewer),
- novel (not in the previous summary),
- faithful (present in the reviews),
- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the reviews).

Guidelines:
- The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, {{summary_length}} words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing.
- Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this app discusses") to reach {{summary_length}} words.
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the users discuss".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the reviews.
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the reviews. NEVER drop entities from the previous summary.
- If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.
- Avoid apps' names other than {{app}} in summaries.
- Avoid personal and location specific information like name, place, URLs, and emails

Remember, use the exact number ({{summary_length}}) of words for each summary.
ONLY Answer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length {{iterations}}) of dictionaries whose keys are ""Iteration turn"", ""Missing_Entities"", ""Denser_Summary"".
